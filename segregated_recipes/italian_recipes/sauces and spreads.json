        "Vegan Bolognese Sauce": "Ingredients: for one very satisfying meal., , , Spaghetti bolognese is a pretty common dish. However, when it comes to knowing how to pronounce bolognese, that can be hit or miss for many people. There\u2019s no shame in that fact though. It\u2019s an odd word, especially for those who aren\u2019t Italian speakers. Bolognese is an Italian word, so the way it\u2019s spelled isn\u2019t how it\u2019s actually pronounced. This is where the confusion comes in., , The word \u201cbolognese\u201d is pretty easy to pronounce once you\u2019ve heard it. The correct pronunciation that\u2019s widely accepted is \u201cbow-luh-naze.\u201d To pronounce it in the original Italian isn\u2019t as easy, and definitely isn\u2019t as easy to explain through text. In Italian, it\u2019s more like \u201cbow-low-nyay-zuh.\u201d Like I said, awkward to try and explain through text, but that should give you a really good idea of how it sounds., , Bolognese is known worldwide and loved by adults and children alike. The Italians really have a knack for delicious dishes, whether it\u2019s, pasta, , , lasagna, , , gnocchi, or, pizza, , I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Italian dishes. I loved to eat spaghetti bolognese as a child, but in the vegetarian version because I stopped eating meat when I was 6 years old., , , , What Is Bolognese?, , If you\u2019re familiar with spaghetti sauce, bolognese sauce is very similar, but it\u2019s usually meat-based. It commonly contains beef, onions, tomatoes, and spices. Of course, my version is a vegetarian bolognese, so it doesn\u2019t contain any meat. However, it doesn\u2019t lack in the flavor department because of it., , Bolognese is an Italian dish and is said to have come from the city of Bologna in Italy. One of its best qualities is that it\u2019s made with, that can often be found in your pantry or fridge. On top of that, , , Crushed Tomatoes, , Celery, , Onion, , Carrots, , Mushrooms, , Lentils, , , As always, then sealing fully once frozen. Do not store bolognese outside the fridge or freezer., , Make it less spicy, \u2013 If you prefer less spice in your spaghetti bolognese, simply nix adding in the crushed red peppers. This should reduce the spice considerably., , , , Perfect For Meal Prep, , This tasty vegetarian bolognese is simply perfect for meal prep as you can store the sauce in individual containers in the refrigerator. Add fresh cherry tomatoes or spiralized zucchini for a low-carb version., , , If you decide to give this comforting vegan bolognese a try, please leave a comment and rating below and don\u2019t forget to tag me in your Instagram or Facebook post with, @elavegan, and #elavegan \u2013 I love seeing your creations!, , If you love easy vegan pasta recipes, make sure to check them out below:, , , Vegan Lasagna Soup, , Spinach & \u201cRicotta\u201d Cannelloni (Vegan Manicotti), , Pumpkin Pasta Bake, , Creamy Pasta Soup, , Vegan Pasta Bake, , Easy Vegan Pasta Salad, , , , , , Vegan Bolognese, , , Author:, Michaela Vais, , , This Vegan Bolognese is a hearty and flavorful dish that\u2019s easy to toss together.

Add all the spices + garlic and saut\u00e9 a bit longer around 1 minute., , , STEP 2:, Add to the pot the wine, tomatoes, lentils, broth, and bay leaf. Stir well., , , STEP 3:, Let the mixture come to a boil before reducing the heat and letting it simmer until the lentils are soft. It takes around 20 minutes, give or take depending on the lentils., , STEP 4:, , STEP 5:, Mix the cornstarch and plant-based milk together in a small bowl. Add it to the mixture, along with the vinegar and soy sauce., , , STEP 6:, Adjust the seasonings as you see fit and serve the lentil bolognese over the pasta., , , Helpful Tips And Variations, , , Soak the lentils, \u2013 If you\u2019re using green or brown lentils, it\u2019s best if you soak them in warm water for about 15 minutes before cooking them. Not only do they cook quicker this way, but they\u2019re easier for your body to digest as well., , Use your favorite pasta, \u2013 You don\u2019t have to use spaghetti for this vegan bolognese. Feel free to use any pasta of choice, regular, gluten-free, or even grain-free pasta. Some other pasta types would be fettuccine, penne, fusilli or rigatoni that are suitable for this vegetarian bolognese. Besides pasta, you can also use gnocchi to make a delicious gnocchi bolognese (so yummy!)., , Lentil alternative, \u2013 If you don\u2019t want to use lentils, you can make a meat-free bolognese with textured soy protein which is also rich in plant-based protein. Simply soak 1 cup of soy curls in warm water until softened and then add them to the pan in place of the lentils., , Add more veggies, \u2013 If you aren\u2019t a big fan of the vegetables included in this bolognese sauce, or you just simply want to add more, you definitely can. Some great suggestions would be eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, etc., , Storage, \u2013 The best way to store this lentil bolognese is in the fridge, in an airtight container. It will last for around 4 days this way. For freezing, place the bolognese sauce in a freezer bag, , I recommend soaking the lentils in lukewarm water if you are using green or brown lentils. This step is optional, however, the lentils cook faster and are furthermore better digested when soaked. You can skip this step if using red lentils., Heat oil in a pan or pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, mushrooms, and carrots. Saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes. Stir in garlic, sweetener, and all spices. Saut\u00e9 for a further one minute, stirring frequently., Add red wine (or vegetable broth), crushed tomatoes, vegetable broth, the bay leaf, and the drained lentils. Stir to combine., Bring to a boil and let simmer for 20 minutes or until the lentils are tender (depending on the variety it can take shorter or longer)., Meanwhile, Add soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. Mix the plant-based milk and cornstarch in a small bowl and add the mixture to the pan., Taste and adjust seasonings. Add more salt/pepper/spices to taste. Also, add more vegetable broth if needed., Serve the lentil bolognese in bowls over pasta and sprinkle, vegan Parmesan, on top (optional). Enjoy! Store bolognese sauce leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 4 days., , , Notes, , Use your favorite pasta, - Feel free to use any pasta of choice, regular, gluten-free, or even grain-free pasta. Besides pasta, you can also use gnocchi. Check out my, gluten-free vegan gnocchi recipe, ., , Lentil alternative, - You can use textured soy protein instead of lentils.

        "Tofu Ricotta": "Ingredients: , , Tofu, \u2013 for the base of the ricotta.\u00a0 Use 1 14 oz package of extra-firm water-packed tofu.\u00a0 You can also use high-protein, tofu that comes in a vacuum pack, but you will need to add more liquid to the ricotta since it\u2019s much firmer., , Nutritional Yeast, \u2013 for a cheesy flavor.\u00a0 This is a cheesy-tasting, yellow powder that they sell at most large grocery stores or natural food stores.\u00a0 You can also easily order it from, Amazon, if you don\u2019t have it in your area.\u00a0 (It is essential for a cheesy flavor in vegan cooking)., , Olive Oil, \u2013 for richness.\u00a0 I usually use light olive oil since it has a more neutral flavor., , Garlic, \u2013 for flavor.\u00a0 You can use a fresh garlic clove or 1/2 tsp of garlic powder., , Salt, \u2013 for flavor. Feel free to reduce the amount of a low-sodium option., , Basil, \u2013 or any other herbs of choice like oregano or parsley for flavor.\u00a0 You can also use some pesto if you have some. (omit basil if you are using the ricotta for a sweet treat)., , Plain Soy Milk, \u2013 to achieve the right consistency. You can also use water if you want. If you use high-protein tofu, you will need up to 1/4 cup of liquid to achieve the correct texture., , , , , Helpful tools, , , Food Processor, \u2013 to blend the tofu.\u00a0 You can do it with a blender or immersion blender if you don\u2019t have a food processor, but you will need to stop and scrape the edges a lot., , , , How to make tofu ricotta, , Step 1, \u2013, Drain and press a container of extra firm tofu getting out as much liquid as possible., , Step 2, \u2013, Crumble the tofu into a large food processor., , Step 3, \u2013, Add, salt, garlic, nutritional yeast, olive oil, and basil.\u00a0 (Omit the garlic and basil if you are using it for a sweet dish)., , , , Step 4, \u2013, Blend well for 2 minutes in a food processor.\u00a0 Add a splash of soy milk if needed to thin out the ricotta to a smooth spreadable texture., , Step 5, \u2013, Use as you would ricotta in your favorite recipes., , , Pro Tips, , , Different brands of tofu vary greatly in firmness and water content.\u00a0 You may not need any additional soymilk if your tofu is softer., , You may add a tablespoon or 2 of sugar to the ricotta if you are using it to fill blintzes or cannoli and be sure to leave out the garlic and herbs., , If using this ricotta for stuffed shells or manicotti, double the recipe to make enough to fill 16 oz. of jumbo stuffed shells or manicotti., , You can even use a very similar process to make a low-carb, tofu pizza crust, out of tofu too!\u00a0 You have to see it to believe it!, , , , , , , How to make tofu spinach ricotta, , If you want to use the ricotta for lasagna, manicotti, or stuffed shells, spinach is a delicious addition to the ricotta.\u00a0 Frozen spinach is the easiest since it is already wilted. (You will need 1 cup of frozen or wilted spinach or 11 cups of raw spinach to equal the same amount)., , To make vegan spinach ricotta, thaw the spinach, put it in a colander, press out the water, then add it to the ricotta.\u00a0 Stir the spinach in with a spoon if you want it to stay in bigger pieces or add the spinach to the food processor and blend if you want it more hidden in the ricotta., , , , , , Adding other veggies, , Add any other veggies that you like to the ricotta.\u00a0 Simply steam them until they are tender, chop them into bite-size pieces, and stir them into the ricotta.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great way to add extra nutrients to a favorite meal., , , , Making ricotta for sweet dishes, , This tofu ricotta also works great in sweet treats as well like, cakes, , , crepes, , , blintzes, ,, and, cannolis, .\u00a0 For use in sweets, make sure to omit the garlic and herbs.\u00a0 Also, be sure to use a light olive oil or swap it out for another neutral-flavored oil.\u00a0 Extra virgin olive oil will have too strong of a taste in sweets.\u00a0 (They taste great in savory dishes, but not in the sweet ones).

Otherwise, I can\u2019t think of anything that would give you a cheesy texture without soy or nuts.  White beans would also work, but it would be a little more like hummus than ricotta.
