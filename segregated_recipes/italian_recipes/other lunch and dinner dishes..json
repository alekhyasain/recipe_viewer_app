        "Vegetarian Skillet Pot Pie": "Ingredients: , , , , 3), , Don\u2019t be intimidated by the slightly longer ingredient list! It\u2019s mostly veggies and dried herbs that you\u2019ve probably got in your kitchen right now! This pot pie is also so easy because it uses refrigerated canned biscuits! Buttermilk, homestyle, or flaky layer biscuits all work well in this recipe!, , If you loved this veggie pot pie, , be sure to check out my:, , Vegetarian Lasagna Soup, , Cheesy One Pot Vegetable Soup, , No Boil Cheese and Spinach Manicotti, , , , , , , , Onion, Celery, Carrot \u2013, Also known as mirepoix, this classic combination of aromatic veggies creates the delicious flavor base for this skillet pot pie. Check your grocery store to see if they have pre-chopped mirepoix to save on prep time!, , Garlic \u2013, Freshly sliced garlic is going to give you the best flavor. If you don\u2019t have time to slice your own, feel free to add 3/4 of a teaspoon of, garlic powder, in place of the fresh garlic., , Dried Herbs \u2013, , Dried thyme, and, dried sage, are my two favorite herbs to use in this recipe. You could substitute with, Italian seasoning, if you like., , Butter \u2013, I prefer to use unsalted, butter, for this recipe so that I can adjust the sodium levels myself., Olive oil, won\u2019t work well as a substitute in this recipe as the butter combines with the flour to create a roux., , Flour \u2013, All-purpose flour works well in this pot pie., , Veggie Broth \u2013, Feel free to sub, chicken broth, for the, veggie broth, if you aren\u2019t worried about keeping this dish vegetarian., , Heavy Cream \u2013, The cream in this recipe is going to give the pot pie mixture that rich texture. Half and half or whole milk are going to make the mixture too thin., , Frozen Peas \u2013, Frozen peas work best for this recipe because they go in frozen and then cook until perfectly tender right in the pot pie. If you use canned peas, they may end up a bit mushy. Frozen green beans would work as a substitute., , Garbanzo Beans \u2013, I like to add, garbanzo beans, to replace the traditional chicken that\u2019s typically in pot pie. They\u2019re a great source of protein and fiber and make the pot pie super hearty and filling., , Refrigerated Biscuits \u2013, Biscuits replace the traditional pie crust or puff pastry. Check the refrigerated section at your grocery store and grab some buttermilk biscuits for this pot pie! No need to make fresh when storebought will work great!, , Egg \u2013, A quick brush of egg wash on the biscuits is going to give them a beautiful dark golden brown color and a little shine., , , , , Copy to clipboard, , Copy to clipboard, , , , , , , , Units, , US, M, , , , Scale, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , , , 2 tablespoons, , olive oil, , 1, yellow onion, diced, , 1.5, , cups, sliced celery, , 1.5, , cups, sliced carrot, , 6, cloves garlic, thinly sliced, , 2 teaspoons, , dried thyme, , 1 teaspoon, , dried sage, , 6 tablespoons, , butter, , 1/2, , cup, , all purpose flour, , 2.5, , cups, , vegetable broth, , 1/2, , cup, heavy cream, , 12, , oz, . frozen peas, , 1, (15 oz.) can, garbanzo beans, (, chickpeas, ), drained, , 16, , oz, . canned biscuit dough, , 1, egg, beaten, , Kosher salt, , fresh cracked pepper, , fresh chopped parsley for garnish, , , , , , ,  Instructions: , , , , 4), , , , , , 5), , Storage and Reheating, , , , , 6), , Tips, , , , , 7), , Try these vegetarian recipes!, , , , , 8), , One-Pot Broccoli Cheese Noodle Soup, , , , , 9), , Easy Burrata Cheese Appetizer, , , , , 10), , One Pot Cheesy Potato Soup Recipe, , , , , 11), , Easy Spinach and Artichoke Cheese Bread, , , , , 12), , Vegetarian Pot Pie, , , , You Will Love This, , , It\u2019s a super quick and easy dinner that cooks entirely in ONE skillet or, large saute pan, !, This means that you can go from stovetop, ,, to oven, to the dinner table in under an hour with minimal prep! You can even make it ahead of time so all you\u2019ve got to do is heat the filling until warm and then bake!, , This veggie pot pie is a hearty vegetarian meal that\u2019s perfect for a meatless Monday, , or any day of the week when you\u2019re trying to get more veggies in your diet but are also craving comfort food. It\u2019s the perfect balance of indulgent nourishment!, , , Saute onion, celery, and carrot, along with a couple pinches of salt and pepper for about 8 minutes., , , Add garlic, thyme, sage, and, butter, and cook, stirring frequently for 1 minute., , , Then stir in flour and cook for another minute., , , Reduce heat to medium and stir in heavy cream and, vegetable broth, ., , , Stir in frozen peas and, chickpeas, ., , , Cook just for a minute or so until it thickens slightly., , , Add biscuits on top of the pot pie filling and brush the biscuits with the beaten egg., , , Bake for 15 minutes. Then cover with a sheet of tin foil and bake for another 15 minutes. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and enjoy!, , , , , This vegetarian pot pie recipe is the perfect make-ahead meal!, You can go ahead and prep the filling with all the veggies and then store it in the fridge in an, airtight container, for up to 5 days until you\u2019re ready to eat., , You could also freeze the filling for up to 2 months, in an, airtight container, . Just thaw the frozen pot pie filling in the fridge overnight before heating it., , When it\u2019s dinner time,, preheat your oven to 375 degrees, , , Storage and Reheating, , , Storage:, Store leftover veggie pot pie in an, airtight container, in the refrigerator for up to a week. I find it easiest to store the biscuits and pot pie separately so that you can stir broth or cream into the pot pie when reheating., , Reheating:, Reheat the pot pie in a baking dish or, large saute pan, in a 350 degree oven until warmed through. You may need to stir in a splash or two of broth or heavy cream to loosen up the pot pie mixture before reheating. For this reason, I find it easiest to reheat the pot pie in a baking dish and the biscuits on a, baking sheet, . Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving., , , , Tips, , , If you don\u2019t have an, enameled cast iron pan, (like the one pictured in this recipe) that can go from stovetop to oven, you can just cook the filling on the stove in a regular pan, and then transfer it to an oven-safe baking dish to bake the biscuits and finish the dish. But, this pan, is seriously my favorite, and also pretty affordable so if you\u2019re in the market, I\u2019d highly recommend it! It\u2019s incredibly durable and you\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s the pan I use in all my one pot recipes (like, Mushroom Stroganoff, , , Skillet Chicken Parmesan Casserole, , and, One Pot Mac and Cheese, )., , Be sure to just gently place the biscuits on TOP of the filling, don\u2019t press them into it., The biscuits will cook all the way through on the top and get nice and golden brown, but the bottom part that\u2019s touching the pot pie filling will remain a bit soft and will end up almost like the texture of a dumpling. This is how it\u2019s supposed to be! I am quite averse to anything remotely soggy, and actually really enjoyed the dumpling texture on the bottom of the biscuits!

I will say that there were wayyyyy too many veggies for my 12\u201d cast iron skillet, but that\u2019s a good thing! I made a whole \u2018nother batch in a 9\u00d79 glass baking dish and even had more left over \u2013 I\u2019ll use them for something else. I did eyeball the sliced herbs for the drizzle, and I added extra slivers of garlic (2 cloves) randomly tucked into the arranged veg before baking. Served with mini burrata and crusty bread, this is a killer cheap vegetarian weeknight meal. Definitely adding to my rotation!

        "Vegan Mushroom Stroganoff": "Ingredients: this dish is extremely satisfying. The mushroom sauce is gluten-free, dairy-free, ready in 25 minutes, and loved by kids and adults alike., , Mushroom Stroganoff was my absolute favorite dish when I was a child. I was a picky eater back then and I almost never finished a meal. However, when my mom made this dish I licked out the entire plate! I am not kidding! I wasn\u2019t vegan as a kid, I was vegetarian though. However, it\u2019s not difficult to make this Mushroom Stroganoff vegan., , Did you know that back in the late 1800\u2019s in Russia, they held cooking contests? Well, not just any cooking contest, but contests with some of the best chefs around. The chefs usually worked for wealthy families, companies, or businesses. The contests were held yearly and the chefs were usually chosen to represent these big companies., , If the chef of that company won (even if they were the one who created the recipe themselves) it was customary that they name the dish after their employer. More specifically, the owner of the company or business they worked for., , Stroganoff was actually a recipe that was created out of this contest. The year was 1891 and the winner was an amazing French chef who worked for a wealthy family of the name Stroganov. When his recipe won the contest that year (which he created just for the contest) as was customary, he named it after his employer \u2013 the Stroganov family., , From there on out, the new recipe was formerly known as \u201cBeef Stroganov\u201d or \u201cBeef Stroganoff\u201d and was eventually passed all around the world as a favorite dish., , What is Stroganoff?, , As mentioned before, Stroganoff is a Russian dish that goes by both names \u201cStroganoff\u201d and \u201cStroganov.\u201d The first spelling is simply a rendition of the family\u2019s names that simply comes from the recipe being passed all around the world., , The traditional homemade Stroganoff dish is strips of beef, cooked in a sauce that\u2019s heavy on the sour cream, and then it\u2019s served over egg noodles. However, my Stroganoff version is, of course, , vegan, . I use a delicious mushroom sauce in place of the beef and sour cream, that\u2019s definitely not lacking in the creamy and tasty department. In fact, I think this is an easy Stroganoff recipe in comparison to the traditional., , this dish is extremely satisfying. The mushroom sauce is gluten-free, dairy-free, ready in 30 minutes, and loved by kids and adults alike., , , 4.96, from, 204, votes, , , Servings, 2, , , Prep, 10, minutes, , mins, Cook, 20, minutes, , mins, Total, 30, minutes, , mins, , , , Rate recipe, , Print recipe, , Pin recipe, , , , , , , , , , Video, , , , , , , , , , , 1x, 2x, 3x, \u25a2, 1, , , , onion, , diced, \u25a2, 2-3, , , , garlic cloves, , minced, \u25a2, 1, , tbsp, , , , vegetable oil, \u25a2, 11, , oz, , , (, 300, , g, ), , fresh mushrooms, , sliced (*see notes), \u25a2, 4, , tbsp, , , (, 40, , ml, ), , white wine, , (optional) (*see notes), \u25a2, 1, , tbsp, , , , tamari, , or soy sauce, \u25a2, \u00be, , cup, , , (, 180, , ml, ), , vegetable broth, , or water, \u25a2, \u00be, , cup, , , (, 180, , ml, ), , plant-based milk, , or cream (*see notes), \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , , , cornstarch, \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , , , onion powder, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , , , garlic powder, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , , , smoked paprika, \u25a2, 1, , pinch of, , , , red pepper flakes, \u25a2, , , Salt & black pepper, , to taste, \u25a2, 1, , tbsp, , , , nutritional yeast flakes, , (optional), \u25a2, , , Fresh thyme leaves and/or parsley (and/or tarragon), , chopped, \u25a2, , , Serve with rice or pasta of choice, , I have your recipe book and I love it!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ela, , , 29.

Arrange in a circular pattern in a colander and place in the sink to draw out the bitter taste of the eggplant., Let rest for 15 minutes, then rinse and arrange on a clean absorbent kitchen towel. Top with another clean dish towel and lay a baking sheet on top. Place something heavy on top, such as a, cast iron skillet, , to thoroughly dry for at least 10 minutes., In the meantime, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with foil and spritz with nonstick spray. Also, if making pasta, bring water to a boil in a large saucepan., Prepare your dipping stations by placing almond milk + cornstarch in one bowl; flour in another bowl; and bread crumbs + sea salt + oregano +, vegan parmesan, (or nutritional yeast) in another bowl., Once thoroughly dry, dip eggplant slices in flour, then almond milk mixture, then breadcrumbs. Arrange on the baking sheet and pop in oven to bake for a total of 20-30 minutes., IMPORTANT STEP: While the eggplant is in the oven, bring a large skillet to medium heat. Once hot, add 2 Tbsp olive oil (or sub avocado oil // adjust amount if altering default number of servings) and pull 3-4 eggplant rounds out of the oven at a time and saut\u00e9 to give them extra crisp and texture. Cook for ~2 minutes on each side (or browned) and then return to oven to continue crisping. Do this in batches until all rounds are browned., While eggplant is browning in the oven, prepare marinara. I prefer adding my tomato sauce and spices to a serving bowl and microwaving to warm, but you could also heat it on the stove. Set aside., Once done cooking, drain pasta and cover with a towel to keep warm. Set aside., To serve: Plate pasta and eggplant slices and marinara in a dish as a dipping sauce.

Super delicious and fairly simple to make., , Other notes: I subbed tapioca starch for cornstarch (2:1 ratio), and I used a wider eggplant (narrowest slices are the crispiest but all are delicious).

We haven\u2019t tried using lemon juice on eggplant, but think it might make it taste acidic because it soaks up liquid so well! You might be better off just skipping step 1!

        "Vegan Chickpea Meatballs": "Ingredients: little effort, and no fancy equipment would be even better!, , Usually my inspiration for roasted red pepper sauces comes from, muhammara, or, romesco, . I even have a Catalan, salbitxata, inspired sauce! All of these sauces have a key nut component, usually almonds, or walnuts., , But today\u2019s sauce doesn\u2019t use nuts for creaminess, instead coconut milk adds creamy lusciousness. Not only does it not get easier than opening up a can of coconut milk, but the coconut flavor complements the roasted red pepper flavor beautifully., , To make the sauce, all you do is combine the roasted peppers, garlic, some olive oil, and spices in a blender and whizz it smooth. Because there are no nuts, this is easy to do even without a fancy blender., , then you just warm it up on the stove!, , , The chickpea meatballs:, , My chickpea meatballs are a personal favorite recipe.\u00a0Versions of them appear throughout my site, in my, vegan meatball subs, , served with, spaghetti in sun dried tomato cream sauce, , and on a, meatball pesto pizza, . I can\u2019t get enough of them!, , I made a few tweaks to the recipe for todays vegan meatballs. With so much flavor coming from the sauce, I didn\u2019t want to compete with it, and instead highlight the Italian herbs and garlicky flavors of the sauce., , These chickpea meatballs couldn\u2019t be simpler to make. The base is made of any leftover grain (my personal favorite is brown rice, but I\u2019ve used different ones over the years and they all work), pecans, and chickpeas., , meaty bean, and buttery nut. The pecans add a nutty, slightly bitter flavor, but you can substitute any nut or use sunflower seeds or pepitas for a nut free version., , In your food processor combine the nuts, grain, and garlic and pulse to finely grind them. Add the chickpeas, reserving some for texture, nutritional yeast, tomato paste, olive oil, and spices. Process them until the mixture holds together when shaped., , If the mixture is soft add the breadcrumbs and process to incorporate. If gluten free, use GF breadcrumbs or use some starch for binding.\u00a0 Then pulse in the remaining chickpeas for texture., , Shape the mixture into large balls, using ~2 \u2013 2 1/2 tablespoons per meatball. Lightly grease the chickpea meatballs and then bake until the outsides are golden and crispy., , , Putting the chickpea meatballs in roasted red pepper sauce:, , Both the sauce and chickpea meatballs can be made in advance. Keep them stored separately in the fridge so the vegan meatballs do not get soggy. There\u2019s no need to cook the sauce until this point either, move it straight from blender to fridge., , When it\u2019s time to eat, cook the roasted red pepper sauce, bringing it to a simmer and then add the chickpea meatballs. Cook until the meatballs are heated through, turning them in sauce to coat., , Serve the meatballs in sauce with toast, pasta, or a side salad. Maybe even all 3! Garnish the recipe with some fresh herbs (parsley or basil), extra black pepper, and some vegan parmesan. No matter how you eat it, this recipe is absolutely delightful!, , I know I can\u2019t get enough., , If you make this vegan chickpea meatballs in roasted red pepper sauce, leave a comment below and rate the recipe on the recipe card.

Very creamy and full of flavour. Meatballs were awful. Just balls of sticky gummy grossness. Hard to blend in the food processor and came out the consistency of cookie dough.

The flavor was really good, the texture wasn\u2019t what I was expecting but still good. My texture was a bit mushy but the balls held together very well. I think next time I might try to make them with quinoa instead of brown rice for a little more protein and maybe to help with the texture. Overall, I really enjoyed the recipe.

Add the rest of the chickpeas and pulse until they are coarsely chopped., Preheat the oven to 375 \u00baF, and shape the mixture into balls using about 2 to 2 1/2 tbsp per ball.

I\u2019m wondering if the garlic could be incorporated into the mix rather then rubbed on bread or just left out., Also wanted to make the chickpeas creamier and then add the tomatoes. Seems it would stay on the bread easier?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Katia, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I\u2019m glad you like the recipe, Debbie! As for the garlic, it\u2019s better to rub the garlic on the crispy bread and taste and smell its aroma rather than just mixing garlic through the mixture. The garlic flavor can be just subtle or more intense (it depends on the quantity of the garlic used) and this is my favorite way to use the garlic when it comes to bruschetta. If garlic is not your thing you can leave it out, but if you like it, it\u2019s worth just rubbing the bread., Re the texture, it\u2019s a good idea make the chickpeas a bit creamier. : ), , , , , , , , , Courtney, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Made this for a gathering of mostly vegans and it was a HUGE hit.
