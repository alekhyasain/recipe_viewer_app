The only thing I changed was I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth and with 1 tsp of Kirkland\u2019s No Salt Seasoning, Casey, 2024-03-07 22:51:28, This is LOADED with flavor. Although I\u2019m not entirely sure how bc there isn\u2019t a lot of spices. I took someone\u2019s suggestion and added miso (well soy sauce\u2026close enough). That was a great decision. 1/2cup of parm is insane, I used 1/4 c and it was PLENTY. Last, again I\u2019m not sure how this has so much flavor but it does and lemon would be a bright addition. 10/10, Grace, 2023-11-02 15:04:03, On my third bowl! \ud83d\ude0b\r\n3 suggestions:\r\n-added a spoonful of miso to quinoa water\r\n- more spices (incl marjoram) \r\n-MUST sprinkle with fresh LEMON!, Patricia, 2023-10-18 14:47:50, I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting but this was delicious!, Debbie, 2023-10-06 21:22:35, I was expecting this to take longer to make, and it was done super quick! Tastes  very good and I put extra mushrooms only because my hubby loves them but there\u2019s so many variations you could do. Is this recipe I really like it! Very versatile and the Italian seasoning gives it a very good flavor, I\u2019d like to try using the Herbes de Provence, I love the combination in that season as well \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb, Angela, 2023-09-24 20:57:08, I thought this recipe was great and easy. I substituted bok choy for the spinach since that\u2019s what I had in hand. I added all of the broth to the mushrooms, removed them with a slotted spoon, then cooked the onion and bok choy in the remaining broth. I\u2019m surprised to see people saying this was flavorless. I disagree but maybe it\u2019s because I used all of the broth., Aws, 2023-02-06 18:11:42, Very yummy! I used stock for the quinoa and added salt due to being dairy free and used nutritional yeast instead of Parmesan. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s even more amazing with cheese! I deglazed the pan with some wine instead for extra flavor and glad I did! Waiting for hubby to get home to get a second verdict on the recipe. Very fast too. By the time my quinoa was done the other pan was too; perfect!, Sarah, 2023-02-03 16:54:58, This recipe is a bit fantastic!  I followed to a T and then, adjusted a few things after it was done!  Added a few drops of liquid smoke, and a bit more onion, and parmesan!  I have never in my life left a review for a recipe, and this one is 100% worthy of it!, Amy, 2023-01-22 10:30:05",

We\u2019re shakin\u2019 things up around here today and we\u2019re enjoying a savory breakfast! So not typical for me, but for some reason, the salty cravings seem to have gotten the better of me., , A while back, I sent out a survey and asked you all what you enjoyed having for breakfast AND if you opted for sweet or savory. To my surprise, the majority of you said savory. I could have sworn most of you had a mega sweet tooth like me, but I\u2019m kind of glad you don\u2019t. It means I get to make new recipes that I wouldn\u2019t normally cook for myself., , As evidence by, my breakfast archives, , sweet breakfasts are the norm, but I have to admit, I was totally of digging the salty spin on these quinoa breakfast bowls., , , It started with homemade pesto., , I\u2019ve made pesto for you before, here, but this time I wanted to pack in a bit more nutrition and decided to add some kale. I\u2019ve found that the trick to making pestos with greens in them is that you need to have the right ratio of greens to basil. Too many greens and your pesto ends up tasting more like a salty salad., , I used about 2 cups of basil to 1 cup of kale and it was just right., , I kept the pesto vegan by using, nutritional yeast, instead of cheese, but kept everything else very traditional: garlic, pine nuts, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Just a few quick pulses in the food processor and the highlight of this meal was done!, , , From there, it was time to think about toppings., , Eggs made sense because they\u2019re, protein packed, , very accessible for everyone and easy to make. (for those of you who don\u2019t eat eggs, I think tofu would also be lovely here) Plus, pesto and eggs together sounds pretty dang awesome., , Avocado because\u2026well it\u2019s avocado and it should be on EVERYTHING., , And to finish everything off, a sprinkle of, hemp hearts, , , chia seeds, and, toasted pine nuts, . Giving us a little more fat, more healthy protein AND omega 3s., , This breakfast bowl is packed full of nutritional goodies my friends!, , , And the best part? It takes maybe 10 minutes to make the entire thing. Start to finish., , Talk about a breakfast win!, , Oh and I totally recommend that you mix it all together before you eat it. It's so good guys! Hope you love it as much as I do\u2764, , , And if you want even more delicious (and fast) breakfast recipes, make sure to hop on my email list because, I\u2019m releasing a brand new eCookbook next Tuesday (9/15), I've just released a brand new eCookbook which features 90+ quinoa breakfast recipes!, , And yes, there\u2019s totally a mix of sweet and savory!, , Click the button below to choose the package that's right for you!, , , I\u00a0can't wait for you to see it!, xo Alyssa, , , , , Savory Pesto Quinoa Breakfast Bowls, , , 4.6, from, 5, votes, , , This breakfast bowl is packed full of nutritional goodies my friends, , , , , author:, Alyssa, , , yield:, 2, , servings, , , , , , , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , , , , Prep:, 5, minutes, , minutes, Cook:, 5, minutes, , minutes, Total:, 10, minutes, , minutes, , , , , Start by adding the eggs to a small saucepan with 1 inch of water in the bottom.

        "Mushroom millet risotto": "Ingredients: , , How to Make Mushroom Risotto, , , Serving Suggestions, , , How to Store and Reheat, , , Can I Freeze Mushroom Risotto?, , , Gluten-Free Risotto-Style Recipes, , What Is Mushroom Risotto?, , Risotto is a type of Italian comfort food dish made with starchy, short-grain rice and stock. When simmered, the mixture becomes super creamy and rich in flavor., , That said, mushroom risotto is simply a risotto that is made with the addition of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and often aromatics like onion and garlic to enhance the flavor. It\u2019s just one of the many variations of traditional risotto recipes along with butternut squash risotto and asparagus risotto., , , , , , Is Risotto Gluten-Free?, , Risotto is made from rice, meaning it\u2019s naturally gluten-free. However, you will want to make sure to double-check the ingredient list and look for brands that are certified as being gluten-free!, , carbohydrates, fiber, etc., , , Vegetable Stock, \u2013 Use, homemade vegetable broth, or store-bought stock. Look for low-sodium varieties to avoid overpowering the dish., , Olive Oil, \u2013 We recommend using light olive oil for a fairly neutral flavor., , Aromatics, \u2013 Shallot or onions and minced garlic form the base of the flavor, adding a subtly sweet, aromatic taste., , Mushrooms, \u2013 We use sliced button mushrooms, but feel free to experiment with any mushrooms you like best such as oyster mushrooms, cremini mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, or chanterelles., , Dry White Wine or Substitute, \u2013 This adds flavor to the risotto and helps the mushrooms sweat. If preferred, cooking sherry can be substituted. Or, use \u00bc cup vegetable stock, 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar, or lime juice in place of white wine to keep this recipe alcohol-free., , Arborio Rice, \u2013, Arborio rice, is a type of short-grain rice that slightly resembles pasta like orzo. For a more nutrient-rich dish, we like to substitute, hulled millet, !, Millet creates the same creamy consistency with extra nutrients like phosphorous, magnesium, and folate, ., , Butter or Non Dairy Substitute, \u2013 Use regular unsalted butter, or substitute your favorite vegan butter for a vegan risotto recipe., , Parmesan Cheese, \u2013 For the best results, use a block of parmesan cheese and grate it yourself., Again, to keep this recipe dairy-free, , use your favorite plant-based cheese. Or, swap it out for nutritional yeast instead., , Spinach, \u2013 Loose leaf spinach is stirred into the skillet for a pop of color and extra nutrients., How to Make Mushroom Risotto, , Heat the stock., Pour the vegetable stock into a heatproof bowl or jar, and microwave on high until hot. Alternatively, you can heat the broth on the stovetop. Either way, you want to keep it warm!, , Saut\u00e9., Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and saut\u00e9 until translucent., , , , , , , , , , , , Sweat the mushrooms., Stir in the sliced mushrooms and salt. Then, increase the heat to high, and add the white wine. Stir to \u201csweat\u201d the mushrooms, allowing them to release their natural water and absorb the wine., , Simmer., Reduce the heat to medium-high, and stir in the rice or millet. Add enough of the warm stock to cover the rice. Stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Next, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender and has absorbed the majority of the stock., , Note:, If you\u2019re using millet instead of rice, you may need to allow the mixture to simmer a little longer in order to achieve the desired consistency., , , , , , , , , , , , Add the remaining stock., Uncover the skillet, and add the remaining warm stock. Then, return the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring frequently until the stock is absorbed., , Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the butter, parmesan, and spinach. Adjust the seasonings to taste., , , , , , , , , , , Serving Suggestions, , This creamy mushroom risotto skillet can easily be served on its own as a complete vegetarian meal. However, if you want to bulk it up, try serving it as a side dish with main courses like:, , Instant Pot Whole Chicken, , Greek Herb Roasted Chicken, , Air Fryer Fish, , Baked Salmon, , , , , , How to Store and Reheat, , Once cooled, leftover risotto can be transferred to an airtight container and stored in the refrigerator for up to five days., , Reheat in the microwave or in a skillet over medium heat. Add an extra splash of broth as needed to freshen the risotto back up., Can I Freeze Mushroom Risotto?, , You can freeze this recipe for up to three months.

You can freeze this risotto in an airtight container (such as a freezer-safe zip-top bag with the air squeezed out of it), but the texture won\u2019t be the same as freshly made just because the mushrooms have a lot of moisture. Thaw overnight in the fridge. Hope that helps!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Kate, , , 11/06/2023 at 4:20 PM, , , , Made this tonight for dinner and it was a hit!

        "Vegan Tomato Risotto with Roasted Veg": "Ingredients: such as dairy-free butter, oil, vegan cheese, nooch or fresh herbs., , , Recipe Shortcuts, , Admittedly, I know roasting the vegetables does add extra time and effort to this dish BUT I do think it's absolutely worth it, flavour-wise. If you're short on time (or feeling lazy) feel free to saut\u00e9 the vegetables instead., , Speaking of lazy, you can also buy frozen roasted Mediterranean vegetables for when you're in a pinch.

I don\u2019t make risotto often and would have found more clarity on how to cook the rice helpful. Bring to a low simmer and msure to cover the pot and stir frequently.  Have plenty of extra broth on hand - a half cup was simply not enough liquid. If you scroll through older reviews you\u2019ll see others making the same comment.

Once the oil is hot, add the onions and garlic and saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes until onions are translucent and fragrant., , , Step Two - Toast the Rice, , Add the rice and toast for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Turn heat down to medium-low and add the white wine and lemon juice and stir until almost all the white wine has dissolved., , , , , Step Three - Cook the Rice, , Using a ladle, scoop one ladle-full of vegetable broth into the rice and stir until it has mostly evaporated. Continue doing this, one ladle at a time, until all the vegetable broth is used and rice is thick and cooked. You may need to add 1 - 2 more ladles of hot water depending on how quickly the rice cooked., , As you add the broth, you'll want to stir constantly to avoid the rice sticking to the bottom and burning as well as allowing you to get a consistent cook on the rice. Once each ladle of broth has absorbed, you add another one until all the broth is gone. This process takes between 20-30 minutes of constant stirring but the effort is so worth it., , When the last ladle has been added, add asparagus, peas, and vegan butter.

        "Rosemary Mushroom Risotto": "Ingredients: , 8 cups vegetable broth (low- or no-sodium), 3 tablespoons vegan butter, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 cup thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms caps, packed, 1 small onion, finely chopped, 2 tablespoons minced garlic, 2 tablespoons minced rosemary, 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast, 1 \u00bd cups arborio rice, 1 cup dry white wine, 1 \u00bd tablespoon Dijon mustard, 1 \u00bd tablespoon mellow white miso, Vegan parmesan, shredded, to taste, Sea salt and pepper, to taste, , Vegetable Options:, , 1 to 2 cups frozen peas, 1 cup fava beans, blanched and peeled, 1 to 2 cups asparagus tips, raw, , ,  Instructions: , 1. Add broth to a small pot and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and set aside., , 2. Melt butter over medium heat, then add olive oil, mushrooms, onions, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9 for 5 minutes until onions are soft. Add garlic, rosemary, nutritional yeast and arborio rice. Stirring often, cook for an additional 3-4 minutes until garlic is soft and rice is toasted. Add the wine, mustard, and miso and mix well. Cook for a few more minutes until the wine has evaporated, stirring frequently so the bottom doesn\u2019t burn., , 3. Once the wine is evaporated, add 1 cup of warm broth to the rice mixture. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the broth is absorbed. Repeat this step, adding the broth in 1 cup increments, until risotto becomes thick and creamy. This should take about 20-30 minutes. If the risotto seems done, give it a taste and you will know. The rice should be chewy, firm, yet tender. You may not use all of the broth and that\u2019s ok. Don\u2019t have a meltdown., , 4. At this point, you can fold in whatever vegetables you are using along with the shredded vegan parm. Give it a taste and season with salt and pepper to your liking. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the asparagus is tender and the peas are bright green. Remove from heat and serve immediately., , , , notes, , To garnish, I like to fry up some additional sliced mushrooms to place on top, as well as some blanched vegetables (especially peas!). That\u2019s because I\u2019m a food stylist and I want it to look extra pretty. You totally don\u2019t have to do this! But if you\u2019d like to impress someone, I suggest that you do. \ud83d\ude09, , , , , , , , , , , , , 11 comments, , , , , , , , , previous post, , , , , One-Pot Pasta Bolognese, , , , , , , , , next post, , , , , Apricot Glazed Tempeh, , , , , , , , You may also like, , , , , , Baked Tofu, , April 10, 2025, , , , , , Kale and Avocado Salad, , April 2, 2025, , , , , , Curried Rice Salad, , March 28, 2025, , , , , , Vegetable Lentil Soup, , March 22, 2025, , , , , , Garlic Toast, , March 21, 2025, , , , , , High Protein Vegan Meals, , March 20, 2025, , , , , , Vegan Guide to New Orleans, , February 4, 2025, , , , , , Easy Vegan Recipes, , January 27, 2025, , , , , , Red Beans and Rice, , January 19, 2025, , , , , , New Year\u2019s Stew, , December 30, 2024, , , , 5 based on 2 reviews, , , Leave a Comment, , Cancel Reply, , , , , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, , , , , , , , Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment., , , , , , , 11 comments, , , , , , , , , , Sue, , December 15, 2018 - 12:30 am, , I made this last night.
