Yes it takes planning and preparation before hand but gives little work the day of the event. It was delicious! \u00a0This recipe does not taste vegan the cashew cream is so good. I did half the lemon juice in the cashew cream and left out the basil because the recipe didn\u2019t say when to add it. Don\u2019t leave out the nutritional yeast. \u00a0It adds to the cheesiness.

You will likely need to use more lasagna noodles but the rest should be the same.

Blend until smooth. You will likely have to scrape down the sides in between blending. Add a tablespoon or so of water at a time if needed to help blend. Careful not to add too much water.\u00a0It should be thick but able to spread., , In a skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil then add the onion and cook for about 3 minutes, until translucent. Add the kale, salt & pepper, and oregano, then cover with a lid and continue to cook until wilted, stirring intermittently. Set aside., , Prepare the lasagna noodles as directed then rinse with cold water to keep from sticking together. In a 9\u00d79\u201d baking dish, spread 1/2 cup of the marinara along the bottom., , Place 2 of the noodles over the marinara then layer roughly 1/2 cup of the cashew ricotta on top. Arrange 1/2 of the butternut squash on top of the ricotta, layer with another 1/2 cup marinara then top with 2 more lasagna noodles., , Spread 1/2 cup of the cashew ricotta on top of the noodles then arrange cooked kale over the top. Add another 1/2 cup marinara then finish with remaining 2 lasagna noodles., , Spread the remaining cashew ricotta on the noodles and arrange the remaining butternut squash on top. Finish with remaining marinara then bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until heated through., , Meanwhile, prepare the pine nut parmesan by combining the toasted pinenuts with nutritional yeast, garlic powder and salt in a food processor or blender. Pulse until a somewhat chunky powder forms., , Remove warm lasagna from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5-10 minutes. Sprinkle pinenut parmesan on top of lasagna and garnish with fresh basil.

Are pineapples an acceptable topping? Deep dish or thin crust? Is it an unforgivable culinary atrocity to eat it with a fork and knife? Families, friends, roommates, and strangers on social media alike have gone to war over these high-profile issues., , Despite all the debate, it seems like at the end of the day, pizza itself is something we can all agree on.

Mix well and press into the prepared baking dish. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until lightly golden. Remove from oven., Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Once hot add the onion, pepper, carrot, and mushroom. Cook just until the onion and pepper are soft. Stir in the Italian seasoning and marinara. Bring to a simmer then remove from heat.

I added cumin, paprika, salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste., Carefully drain the lasagna noodles and preheat your oven to 360 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)., Lay cooked noodles on a clean surface and place about 1/4 cup of the hummus-mixture on each noodle and spread it evenly.

Cook as directed on the package before layering., , Try this, Vegan Sausage-Lentil Lasagna, or, bolognese, for a \u201cmeatier\u201d alternative., , , Storage Suggestions, , There are two reasons to store a perfectly good tray of lasagna. One, if you\u2019re preparing it for future enjoyment, and two, if you have leftovers., , To store a whole lasagna, first, cover and wait until it has cooled down to room temperature. Cover the entire pan with cling film and add extra protection with aluminum foil. You can then freeze it to enjoy in the next three months or refrigerate for 3-5 days., , If you have leftovers, do the same thing as above, but slice and transfer to smaller containers. Make sure the containers are air-tight to prevent the lasagna from drying out., , How to Reheat, , Reheating a slice of leftover lasagna is as easy as microwaving it. If it\u2019s too dry, place the slice in a microwave-safe container filled with a spoonful or two of water. Microwave for 1 to 2 minutes on high, letting the steam and moisture work their magic., , To reheat an entire tray of lasagna, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Bake it uncovered between 10-15 minutes. It\u2019s a perfect time to top it with some more vegan cheese if needed.

        "Vegan Buffalo Chickpea Quesadillas": "Ingredients: omnivores, and picky kids., , Check out the video on Youtube for a look at how to make these (including the trick to getting crispy, not soggy quesadillas). And some, err, cooking mishaps and awkward outtakes lol. There\u2019s also a short food-only video at the end of this post :), , Vegan Buffalo Chickpea Quesadillas: Recipe Video, , , , , , , , , BUFFALO CHICKPEA QUESADILLAS | must-try vegan quesadillas, , , , , , , These quesadillas were so freakin\u2019 delicious that I\u2019ll never be going back to my simple cheese quesadillas. Sure, they take a little more effort and time than plopping some vegan cheese on a tortilla. But they are SO worth it. And they really don\u2019t take, thaaat, much effort and time. As long as you\u2019ve got your cashews soaked in advance, you can make these spicy, cheesy quesadillas in a half hour., , , Ingredient Rundown, , Buffalo Sauce, , Hot Sauce, : For these quesadillas, I married the oh-so-popular Buffalo flavor that people associate with hot wings with my favorite plant protein (chickpeas). The result is a hearty and delicious mashed chickpea buffalo sauce filling. Then I combine this filling with an irresistible Mexican cheese sauce for a match made in heaven., , I wanted the \u201cbuffalo\u201d flavor to be pronounced but not overwhelming, which is often the case in buffalo-flavored foods. I use, Frank\u2019s Xtra hot sauce, for that traditional, spicy \u201cbuffalo\u201d flavor because I like things xtra spicy. If you\u2019re okay with spice but want a slightly more moderate heat, I recommend Frank\u2019s original sauce., , If you can\u2019t find Frank\u2019s hot sauce, you can make your own hot sauce (this is a, copycat recipe, for Frank\u2019s hot sauce). Or use, Cholula, , Tabasco, or any hot sauce of your preference. Since the hot sauce gets mixed with (vegan) butter, you\u2019ll want a hot sauce that\u2019s pretty vinegar-y to balance out the butter., , Vegan Butter, : Buffalo sauce is typically made with a hot sauce and melted butter. But, obviously, we\u2019re going to be using vegan butter! I\u2019ve made this with Violife plant butter, Country Crock Plant Butter, and Earth Balance vegan butter, all with great results., , PS: Looking for more great buffalo-flavored recipes? Try my, Vegan Buffalo Cauliflower, bites!, , , Chickpea Filling, , Chickpeas, , + Aromatics, : Once the hot sauce is mixed in with the melted vegan butter and some spices, it gets folded into the mashed chickpea mixture. I rely on canned chickpeas make this recipe a quick, weeknight-friendly meal. And to give them extra flavor, I first saut\u00e9 an onion and minced garlic in a bit of oil before adding the chickpeas., , PS: If you\u2019re looking for more great quesadilla fillings, these, Chipotle copycat Sofritas, and, Mexican Black Beans, are excellent in quesadillas!, , , Mexican cheese sauce, , This is the EASIEST cheese sauce ever, and it really tastes like a Mexican-flavored cheese dip. It features raw cashews, vegan yogurt, salsa, a few spices, and nutritional yeast., , The hardest part of this recipe is remembering to soak your cashews in advance. If you find that you\u2019ve forgotten to soak your cashews overnight, you can soak them in boiling water for 1 hour., , you should definitely add this cheese sauce to your recipe repertoire because it\u2019s insanely good (and healthy!). It\u2019s great with burritos, enchiladas, tacos, and nachos!, , Tips for making these quesadillas, , For the chickpeas, the recipe calls for one (15-ounce) can of chickpeas because that\u2019s the most convenient amount to use. But if you have extra chickpeas on hand, I like to add about 1 1/2 (15-ounce) cans (about 2 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas). It makes each quesadilla a bit more filling. If you do increase the amount of chickpeas to 1 1/2 cans (2 1/2 cups), you shouldn\u2019t need to make more of the buffalo sauce because the mixture is already so flavorful., , To achieve that, perfectly crisp, crunchy texture on the outside of the quesadilla, , follow this step. Weigh down the quesadilla with another skillet while it cooks in the pan. After a few minutes, flip the quesadilla and do the same for another minute or two. You\u2019ll be in quesadilla heaven, I promise!, , More Delish Chickpea Recipes, , In the mood for more Mexican recipes that are not 100% authentic but are 100% delicious?

Blend until thick, creamy, and smooth. The sauce should be quite thick and creamy, but if you\u2019d like it to be even thicker, add the sauce to a saucepan over medium-low heat for a few minutes to thicken up slightly., Next, make the buffalo sauce, . Melt the vegan butter in a heatproof bowl in the microwave (or in a saucepan on the stove).  To the melted butter, add the hot sauce, garlic powder, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and sugar. Whisk until the hot sauce and butter are completely incorporated., Pour the drained and rinsed chickpeas in a medium bowl and roughly mash them with a fork or a potato masher, leaving some beans intact., Heat the 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat and once the oil is shimmering, add the diced onion. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until softened and they have a little color, then add the garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute., To the onions, add the buffalo-butter sauce and the mashed chickpeas, and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the scallions and stir to combine. Turn off the heat and wipe out the skillet so you can reuse it for making the quesadillas., Assemble the quesadillas, . Spread an even layer of the Mexican Cheese Sauce (1/4-1/3 cup) onto one of the eight tortillas. Arrange about 1/2 cup of the Buffalo Chickpea Filling on top. Place another tortilla on top to cover., Lightly grease the large skillet with a bit of oil and place over medium heat. Once hot, add the prepared quesadilla to the skillet. Place a slightly smaller skillet on top of the quesadilla so that it presses down on the quesadilla, resulting in a nice crispy exterior. I also like to weigh the smaller skillet down with a couple cans of beans/tomatoes or just press down on the skillet with my hands (using a kitchen towel so I don't burn myself)., Cook the quesadillas, for 3 minutes, then flip and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, or until both sides are crispy and nicely browned. Repeat with the remaining sauce, filling, and tortillas., , Notes, Note 1: If you use a very thick, creamy coconut yogurt, you'll need to add more water or broth to slightly thin out the cheese sauce., , Note 2:, use mild or medium salsa unless you looove spicy food since the buffalo sauce is already spicy., , Note 3: If you are sensitive to spicy food, use less hot sauce. Also, keep in mind that each hot sauce has a different level of spiciness. If your hot sauce is very spicy, use a smaller amount., , Note 4: The recipe calls for 1 (15-ounce) can of chickpeas because that\u2019s the most convenient amount to use, but if you have extra chickpeas on hand, I like to add about 1 1/2 (15-ounce) cans (about 2 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas) because it makes each quesadilla more filling., , **** This recipe is gluten-free if you use gluten free tortillas., , , , , , , Nutrition Info, , , , , Calories:, 583, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 67, g, |, Protein:, 18, g, |, Fat:, 29, g, |, Saturated Fat:, 7, g, |, Polyunsaturated Fat:, 7, g, |, Monounsaturated Fat:, 12, g, |, Trans Fat:, 1, g, |, Sodium:, 989, mg, |, Potassium:, 589, mg, |, Fiber:, 9, g, |, Sugar:, 9, g, |, Vitamin A:, 781, IU, |, Vitamin C:, 7, mg, |, Calcium:, 205, mg, |, Iron:, 6, mg, , , , , , , , , Recipes, Lunch, Dinner, Video, , Gluten-Free, , , , , Did you make, this recipe?, , Tag, @rainbowplantlife, and hashtag it, #rainbowplantlife, , , , , , , , , Leave a review, , , , , 4.99 from 300 votes (, 106 ratings without comment, ), , , , Leave a Comment & Rating, Cancel reply, If you enjoyed this recipe, please consider giving it a star rating along with your comment!

I\u2019ve made it a billion times and have shared it with so many people who love it! This recipe is BOMB, the sauce is soooo good I always make extra to eat with chips and salsa.
