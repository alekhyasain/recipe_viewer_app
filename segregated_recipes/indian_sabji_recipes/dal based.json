Instructions: , , , , , , , , Nutrient values, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Sambhar is a dish that is synonymous with South Indian cooking. As it is, sambhar is very nutritious as it combines toovar dal with an assortment of vegetables. While vegetables like red pumpkin, drumsticks and bottle gourd all contribute to the nutrient content of this recipe, the bumper iron top-up comes from the addition of methi leaves, which also adds to the flavour and aroma of the sambhar. Serve the Methi Leaves Sambhar piping hot with idli, dosa, rice or for a change, even with rotis., , , , , , , Tags, , , , , Deep Pan, , Indian Dinner, , South Indian Dinner, , Main Course Recipes, , South Indian, , South Indian Sambar, , High Fiber, , High Fiber Indian Recipes for Diabetes, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Preparation Time, , 15 Mins, , , , , , , Cooking Time, , 30 Mins, , , , , , , Total Time, , 45 Mins, , , , , , , Makes, , 6 servings, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Combine the toovar dal, tomatoes, onions, pumpkin, bottle gourd, turmeric powder, salt and 3 cups of water in a pressure cooker, mix well and pressure cook for 3 whistles., Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid and keep aside., Combine the drumstick and \u00bd cup of water in a deep non-stick pan and cook on a medium flame for 5 minutes.

        "Dal Fry": "Ingredients: , Here is how we make it. First, the lentils are cooked until soft and mushy. Note that we do not cook al dente lentils., , Table of Contents, About Dal Fry Recipe, Why I love This Dal Fry, How to Make Dal Fry, Expert Tips, FAQs, Recipe Card, , The soft-cooked lentils or dal is then mixed with a saut\u00e9ed base mixture of spices, onions, tomatoes and herbs. Then simmered for a few minutes until you get the desired consistency., , In the Indian terminology, we often use the word \u2018fry\u2019 for \u2018saut\u00e9ed\u2019 and hence the term dal fry. Though technically speaking nothing is deep fried or shallow fried., , Why I love This Dal Fry, , My Dal Fry recipe offers you a lot of restaurant-like flavors and you will love it to relish with some roti or rice or paratha or even with tandoori roti., , It is usually prepared with arhar dal, also known as toor, toovar (yellow lentils) or pigeon pea lentils., , I like to use an equal mix of masoor dal (pink or orange lentils) and tuvar dal (pigeon pea lentils), but this recipe is easily adaptable with any lentils you have in your pantry. But I highly recommend to use lentils which are in their shelf life., , , To add more, you can smoke the Dal Fry with charcoal. I have mentioned in detail about this smoking technique in my, Dal Tadka Recipe, which you can have a look at., , I usually cook the lentils in a stove-top pressure cooker, but you can cook them in a pan or in an Instant Pot if you do not have a stovetop pressure cooker on hand. Details are given in the recipe card below., , Lentil recipes like these are famous in the, Dhabas, (highways and roadside eateries)\u00a0in India, though the, Dhaba Dal, served in the, Dhabas, has a different taste and flavor than this dal recipe., , , then buy them online or from an Asian or Indian grocery store., , Veggies:, You will need an onion and tomato, both finely chopped for this dal recipe., , Green Chilies:, Not as hot as jalape\u00f1os but just the right level of spice for the dish., , Curry Leaves:, The subtle flavor of curry leaves are essential in this recipe. But if you don\u2019t have it, then might well as skip it \u2013 though some flavor profile will be amiss., , Asafoetida Powder (hing):, If using a strong asafoetida, then just one pinch is enough. I would definitely recommend adding a small amount at a time and seasoning to taste. And if you do not have asafoetida, then simply skip it., , Coriander leaves (cilantro):, This simple herb brings a much needed hint of freshness to the Dal Fry., , Kasuri Methi (dry fenugreek leaves):, Brings restaurant style flavors to the dal and gives a nutty aroma. Skip if you do not have it., , Additional Seasonings:, You will also need several Indian pantry staples, including ginger, black mustard seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, Garam Masala powder, oil, lemon juice, and salt., , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to Make Dal Fry, , Cook Dal, , 1. Rinse your lentils in water for 3 to 4 times. I would recommend using \u00bd cup tuvar dal (arhar dal or pigeon pea lentils) or \u00bc cup each of tuvar dal and masoor dal (pink or orange lentils)., , , , 2. After rinsing, pour the lentils into a 2-liter pressure cooker and toss in a pinch of turmeric powder and 1.5 cups of water., , , , 3. Pressure cook the lentils for 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat, or until they are thoroughly cooked and completely soft. Once lentils are cooked, mash them with a spoon or wired whisk, then set aside., , Tip:, , You can see the consistency of the cooked lentils in the photo below. It is important to note that there should be no separate grains visible., , , , Saut\u00e9 Onions, Tomatoes, Spices, , 4. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil, ghee or unsalted butter in a pan or skillet. Once hot, add \u00bd or \u00be teaspoon of black mustard seeds., , , , 5. When you hear the mustard seeds start crackling, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and fry them with the mustard seeds for several seconds or until they change color., , You should hear the same crackle for the cumin seeds!, , , , 6. With the mustard and cumin seeds still in the pan, add \u2153\u00a0cup of chopped onions., , , , 7. Saut\u00e9 the seeds and onion mixture until the onions become translucent or lightly browned., , , , 8. When the onions have lightly browned, add in 1 to 1.5 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste and stir to combine. Saut\u00e9 the mixture for a few seconds or until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic goes away on a low heat., , Tip:, Make your own paste by combining 1 inch ginger with 3 to 4 medium-sized garlic cloves, crushed to a paste in a mortar-pestle., , , , 9. Finally, add in 10 to 12 curry leaves, 2 to 3 dry red chilies, and 1 to 2 green chilies. Stir to combine with the ginger-garlic paste mixture., , Tip:, You can skip the curry leaves if you don\u2019t have them! I always like to add curry leaves, as they add such a nice flavor to the dish., , , , 10.\u00a0Mix well on a low heat, stirring to combine the flavors., , , , 11. Add all the spice powders and mix again!, , \u00bd teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric), , \u00bd teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne or smoked paprika (For a light smoky flavor), , 1 to 2 pinches of asafoetida, or hing (Skip if you do not have it.), , , , 12. After mixing thoroughly, add about \u2153 to \u00bd cup of finely chopped tomatoes., , , , 13. Stir together one more time and continue to saut\u00e9 until the tomatoes become soft and pulpy., , The oil should also start to leave the masala mixture, which is an indication that the onion-tomato base mixture is fully cooked., , , , Make Dal Fry, , 14. Add your mashed lentils to saut\u00e9ed onion-tomato masala mixture in the pan or skillet., , , , 15. Combine and mix everything evenly with the rest of the masala mixture., , , , 16. Pour 1 to 1.5 cups of water. You can adjust the consistency of the dal by adding more or less water as per your taste preferences., , , , 17. Mix and stir thoroughly to get a smooth and even consistency., , , , 18. Season with salt as per taste. Stir and mix again., , , , Simmer Dal Further, , 19. Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes on low to medium heat. Stir occasionally, so that the lentils do not stick to the bottom of the pan., , , , 20. Add 1 teaspoon of crushed kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and sprinkle \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon of garam masala powder., , Tip 1:, You can substitute kasoori methi with a pinch of fenugreek seeds powder. If you don\u2019t have either, then just skip this step., , Tip 2:, , If you are using homemade or a more intense garam masala, then add \u00bc teaspoon., , , , 21. Stir and simmer for 1 minute., , , , 22. Turn off the heat and add 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves. You can also add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon lemon juice at this step for a little added freshness and tang., , , , 23. Stir just one last time., , , , Serve Dal Fry hot or warm with paratha, roti, jeera rice or plain steamed basmati rice accompanied with an optional, Onion Raita, , papad, lime/lemon slices or mango pickle or onion salad or the favorite, Kachumber Salad, ., , You can also opt to garnish with some more coriander leaves while serving., , For the best taste and flavor consume it as soon as it is prepared. On reheating you will need to add a bit of water., , I do not recommend to refrigerate or store the dal overnight or for a day as lentils are best eaten when freshly cooked and have optimum health benefits. Moreover on refrigerating the flavor and consistency of the lentils change considerably., , , , Serving Suggestions, , Roti, is a round flatbread popular in India, and a staple bread that is served with lentils or curries. Soft roti tastes great with piping hot dal., , Naan, , a leavened flatbread made in some countries in Asia, is not as much of an Indian household staple as roti, but it is still a deliciously soft and slightly chewy side option., , Steamed rice, always goes great with dal recipes, and you can make it in the pressure cooker or instant pot to save cook time., , Jeera Rice, , which is a simple yet delish cumin flavored rice is a fabulous option to serve with Dal Fry., , Expert Tips, , Consistency:, You can alter the consistency of dal by adding less or more water. If you prefer a thinner consistency, then increase the amount of water a bit and not too much. If dal becomes thin or runny, the flavors will get diluted and it won\u2019t taste good. Keep checking and if needed, add more water., While serving with rice we keep the consistency to medium. When serving with roti or phulka we keep the consistency slightly thick. On cooling the dal will thicken a bit., , Fats:, Dal Fry always taste better with ghee. But you can make it with oil or butter. Use sunflower oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, mustard oil or coconut oil. Note that mustard oil and coconut oil will give their taste and flavor in the lentils \u2013 so add according to your preferences., , Smoky flavors:, For more restaurant style flavors, , , For pressure cooking lentils, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , pigeon pea lentils, , \u2013 hulled and split, (tuvar dal, arhar dal, toor dal) or \u00bc cup each of masoor dal and toor dal, \u25a2, 1.5, , cups, , water, , \u2013 for stovetop pressure cooking, \u25a2, 1, , pinch, , turmeric powder, , (ground turmeric), \u25a2, 2 to 3, , tablespoons, , oil, , (neutral flavored) or unsalted butter or ghee (clarified butter), \u25a2, \u00bd to \u00be, , teaspoon, , mustard seeds, , (black), \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , cumin seeds, \u25a2, \u2153, , cup, , onions, , \u2013 finely chopped, or 1 medium-sized, \u25a2, 1 to 1.5, , teaspoons, , Ginger Garlic Paste, , or 1 inch peeled ginger & 3 to 4 medium peeled garlic cloves crushed in a mortar-pestle, \u25a2, 2, , green chilies, , \u2013 slit or chopped, \u25a2, 2 to 3, , dry red chilies, , \u2013 kept whole or halved and deseeded, optional, \u25a2, 10 to 12, , curry leaves, \u25a2, 1 to 2, , pinches, , asafoetida powder, , (hing) \u2013 for a strong asafoetida, just one pinch is enough, \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , turmeric powder, , (ground turmeric), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , red chili powder, , or cayenne pepper or smoked paprika, \u25a2, \u2153 to \u00bd, , cup, , tomatoes, , \u2013 finely chopped, or 1 medium-sized, \u25a2, 1 to 1.5, , cups, , water, , or add as required, \u25a2, salt, , as required, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , dry fenugreek leaves, , (kasuri methi), \u25a2, \u00bc to \u00bd, , teaspoon, , Garam Masala, \u25a2, \u00bd to 1, , teaspoon, , lemon juice, , \u2013 optional, \u25a2, 2 to 3, , tablespoons, , coriander leaves, , \u2013 chopped, (cilantro) \u2013 for garnish, , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark while making the recipe,  Instructions: , WhatsApp, Facebook, Pin, Tweet, Email, Shares, 13, , About Dal Fry Recipe, , In Hindi language, \u2018dal\u2019 or \u2018dahl\u2019 is the generic term for lentils as well as the, recipes made from lentils, .

        "Dal Bhukara": "Ingredients: , WhatsApp, Facebook, Pin, Tweet, Email, Shares, 4.1k, , Table of Contents, About Dal Bukhara, How to make Dal Bukhara (Stepwise Photos), My Journey with Dal Bukhara, Expert Tips, FAQs, Recipe Card, , About Dal Bukhara, , Dal Bukhara, the more refine version of the very well-known dal makhani, is nothing but whole black gram (urad dal) slow-cooked with tomato puree, choices of spices and herbs, and finished with copious amounts of cream and butter. This is exactly how it should be kept, for the real essence of the dish can only be experienced this way., , Dal Bukhara as a dish rose to fame when Chef Madan Jaiswal of the renowned Bukhara restaurant at ITC Maurya, New Delhi created it for its guests and patrons. It was well-received by all and has been associated with many accolades since then., , Traditionally, Dal Bukhara is slow-cooked on charcoal ovens in restaurants. But this version is recreated at home and hence involves pressure cooking the lentils in the initial stage, followed by slow-cooking the dish on a stove-top., , More On This Recipe, , I call this version of Dal Bukhara as my \u2018labor of love\u2019 towards cooking and food in general. Since the time I had a rendezvous with this simply amazing dish, I\u2019d wanted to recreate it in my home., , To begin with, I experimented and made Dal Bukhara twice and felt something was missing. The third time it came close to the original one. The only aspect missing was the charcoal flavor., , So, I read more and more on how to bring that touch of uniqueness and got myself accustomed to the technique of smoking, popularly known as, dhungar, . Details on this are in the notes section after the recipe card. You can also find more about this technique in my recipe of, Dal Tadka, ., , I have not slow-cooked the lentils overnight on tandoor, because neither I have wooden or charcoal embers nor do I have a tandoor at home. I don\u2019t even have a slow-cooker that would do a similar job., , So, I have pressure cooked the lentils first and then slowly simmered the dal with tomato, cream, butter and ginger-garlic for 1 hour 25 mins, on low heat., , , This Dal Bukhara recipe is quite rich because of the amount of butter and cream that goes into the preparation. I did try with a lesser amount of butter and cream and it just had that \u2018something is missing or just not right\u2019 thing about it., , To get the real taste and feel, I would recommend not to reduce the cream or butter. Just make sure to run an extra mile or exercise a bit more to burn all the \u2018sin\u2019 that you are going to consume!, , I have used unsalted white butter and 25% low-fat cream (a.k.a light cream). You can use any good brand of butter and 25% to 35% light cream or whipping cream. I served this Dal Bukhara with jeera rice and some onions by the side., , You can also try it with naan, lachha paratha, phulka, tandoori roti or khasta roti, and decide for yourself which combination is the best., , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to make Dal Bukhara, , Prep and Cook Lentils, , 1. Soak 1.5 cups whole black gram (urad dal) in enough water overnight or for 7 to 8 hours. Drain them later and add to a 3 or 4-litre stove-top pressure cooker., , Add 4.5 to 5 cups water and pressure cook the lentils for 16 to 18 whistles or about 18 to 20 minutes. The photo below is of the soaked and drained lentils., , Note, that you can choose to cook the lentils in an Instant Pot instead of a stove-top pressure cooker. For cooking in Instant Pot, add 4.5 cups of water or as needed and pressure cook lentils on high for 25 minutes. Wait for natural pressure release and after 18 to 20 minutes open the lid. Lift the pressure valve first to release any steam or pressure and then only open the lid., , , 2. As the lentils are getting cooked, make a smoooth and fine puree of 250 grams tomatoes (3 medium to large tomatoes) in a blender., , Crush 1 inch ginger and 4 to 5 medium garlic cloves to a paste (2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste) in a mortar-pestle., , , 3. When the pressure settles down naturally in the cooker, then only open the lid of the pressure cooker. The lentils should be cooked well and softened., , , 4. Now add the prepared ginger-garlic paste, tomato puree, 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder, 6 to 7 tablespoons white butter, 7 to 8 tablespoons low fat cream or light cream, 1 to 1.5 cups water and salt., , If using heavy cream or whipping cream add 3 to 4 tablespoons of it., , , Make Dal Bukhara, , 5. Mix very well and keep the pressure cooker on low heat on the stovetop, without its lid., , For the Instant pot, , after the lentils have cooked, use the saut\u00e9 function and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes or more until you get the desired consistency. Stir often., , , 6. Let the dal simmer for about 1 hour or more. Meanwhile keep on stirring often, so that the lentils don\u2019t stick at the bottom of the cooker., , , 7.\u00a0 Towards the end, check the taste and add more red chili powder or salt if required. Lastly, sprinkle \u00bd teaspoon garam masala powder and stir well., , The consistency of dal bukhara is not runny or watery. So if your dal bukhara looks runny, then continue to cook further., , , 8.\u00a0While serving Dal Bukhara, dot with 1 tablespoon\u00a0butter or cream. Serve hot with, Jeera Rice, and onion salad., , , My Journey with Dal Bukhara, , I first came across this simple, but celebrated lentil dish in Femina magazine many years ago. The recipe section featured some chef\u2019s chosen ones from ITC Maurya, in which the Dal Bukhara recipe was also shared., , When I read the Dal Bukhara recipe first time, I was surprised that it bore close resemblance to butter chicken or paneer makhani. Also, dal makhani was not in my repertoire then., , Today, I can say that the sauce made for Dal Bukhara and dal makhani is similar to butter chicken. What I felt and thought many years back is confirmed in an excellent informative piece, here, by Vir Sanghvi., , I had started collecting recipe cut-outs and keeping them safe in my dairy. But with we shifting our home a few times and along with usual changes in life, Dal Bukhara became a forgotten recipe., , When I started food blogging, I went back to my diary for the recipe and could just find a few pages left of the many that I had kept. Out of the pages that were misplaced amidst the hustle-bustle, one of them had the authentic Dal Bukhara recipe of the ITC Maurya fame. This really hurt me back then., , But due to my innate nature of not giving up and a true fondness for food, and then I never looked back. It did take me a few trials and a lot of patience until I developed a Dal Bukhara recipe that I could be proud of., , Expert Tips, , While cooking the dal on simmer, the lentils become viscous and start to stick at the bottom of the cooker if not stirred.

Also, sake sure to keep mashing some of the lentils while stirring., Use lentils that are within their shelf life and fresh. Do not use aged lentils as they take a lot of time to cook and do not taste good., The consistency of Dal Bukhara is similar to dal makhani., You can garnish Dal Bukhara with ginger juliennes and also serve with Indian flatbreads like naan, paratha or roti., FAQs, , Is it necessary to add cream in this dal?, , Dal Bukhara is a rich, creamy dal. Not adding the cream would result in some flavor loss. So, it is best to add the cream., , , What is the substitute for fresh cream in this recipe?, , You can use whipping cream instead of fresh cream in this recipe.

On low or high heat?, , You should cook this dal on low heat as this recipe calls for cooking of the dal slowly., , , How to make restaurant style Dal Bukhara?, , This recipe will give you a Dal Bukhara that is very close to the restaurant style one.

Your dal bukhara version is my version of Dal makhni. I read it many years ago in a Sanjeev Kapoor cook book and since then I am making it this way only. The only difference is as its dal makhni I add finely chopped onion, garlic and ginger while cooking the dal and once its done I add 1cup whole milk and after few minutes pureed tomatoes.

        "Dal Palak": "Ingredients: , , Pappu:, Traditionally toor dal is the standard lentil used to make this dish. But a lot of times I add little moong dal along with toor dal for flavor and texture. For the podi pappu, we I use only moong dal., , Palakura:, Use young spinach or baby spinach. Mature spinach takes longer to cook and can have a metallic taste. But if that\u2019s what you have, remove the stalks and use only the leaves., , Aromatics, : Onions, garlic and green chilies add flavor and heat., , Tomatoes:, I generally do not use tomatoes in my palakura pappu but instead use tamarind or lemon juice.

While the dal cooks, pluck spinach leaves (2 cups/100 grams/4 to 5 ounce) and wash them in lot of water several times. Drain them and chop. Add the chopped palakura to the hot dal and let cook until wilted. If your dal is too thick you may add a splash of hot water., , , , 3. When the spinach is cooked completely, it looks wilted and blends well with dal. Add \u2153\u00a0teaspoon sea salt (start with less), \u215b teaspoon turmeric and strained tamarind water (start with less). Stir and mix well. Taste test to adjust salt and tamarind., , , , Temper, , 4. Heat 1\u00bd to 2 tablespoon ghee or oil in a pan. Add \u00bc\u00a0teaspoon mustard seeds, \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 broken dried red chili, 1 chopped green chili (optional for extra heat) and garlic. When the spices splutter, add curry leaves (pat dry first) and hing. Turn off. (If you want you can stir in \u2153 teaspoon red chili powder for green chilies).

        "Palak Arhar Dal": "Ingredients: , In this post I share 2 recipes to make dal palak. I make the first recipe without tomatoes and the second one with tomatoes., , A lot of Indians avoid cooking tomatoes and spinach together due to the high oxalate content in both of them. So if you are on a low oxalate diet, always skip tomatoes in the dal palak., , At home, we believe moderate consumption of tomatoes with spinach is okay for healthy people so I do cook this combination but not very often. I use them together in this dal palak, sambar, palak paneer and a few more dishes., , Since I use tomato in the second recipe, tomatoes and spinach are used in moderate quantities. This recipe is our absolute favorite, so delicious and super quick to make as there is no saut\u00e9ing of onions or tomatoes and is also easy., , , , Spinach/ Palak:, Using fresh young/baby spinach is very important. Mature leaves impart metallic and bitter flavors while baby/young spinach give sweeter flavors. Remove the stalks and more mature leaves before using., , Lentils:, Traditionally toor dal aka split pigeon peas are used widely. However you can use any kind of skinned lentils for this recipe like red lentils (masoor dal), yellow mung lentils (moong dal) or Bengal gram (chana dal). I personally prefer to use 50/50 toor dal and moong dal or red lentils and moong dal. Mung dal produces a thicker and more flavorful dal. But do note that if you want to use chana dal, you need to soak them in hot water for at least an hour., , Spices:, You can use cumin seeds and mustard seeds (optional) to temper the dal palak. Remember not to use a lot of mustard, they can make your dal taste bitter. Ground spices like turmeric, red chili powder (can omit to use green chilies) and garam masala (optional) are used., , Chilies:, I love to use green chilies and dried red chilies for both heat and pungent flavors. Feel free to use what you have on hand. If you use green chilies, you may omit dried red chili and red chili powder or vice versa., , Ginger and garlic :, You may use both or any one of these fresh spices. They add a great aroma to your dal. Do not substitute with ground ginger or garlic because they don\u2019t make substitutes., , Hing/ asafetida, is a gum resin and it adds a great flavor to the tempering. Most brands come with a small amount of gluten added to it. Look for a gluten-free version if you eat gluten-free or simply omit it., , Fats \u2013 oil/ ghee, : I prefer using ghee to temper my dal. It adds a more substantial flavor to your dish. But if you can\u2019t eat you may use coconut oil, avocado oil or grapeseed oil., , , More, Dal recipes, Moong dal recipe, Chana dal, Masoor dal, Dal makhani, Dal fry recipe, Khichdi, , , Photo Guide, , How to make Dal Palak without Tomatoes (Stepwise Photos), , , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , For best results follow the step-by-step photos above the recipe card, , , , , , Prep Time, 10, minutes, , minutes, Cook Time, 20, minutes, , minutes, Total Time, 30, minutes, , minutes, , Servings, 3, , Author, Swasthi, , , , \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , toor dal, , (or red lentils/masoor dal, read notes), \u25a2, 1\u00bc, , cup, , water, , or as needed (1\u00bd cups for Instant pot), \u25a2, 1, , small, , tomato, , (chopped, optional, read notes), To Temper, \u25a2, 2 cups (100grams), , palak, , (spinach fine chopped), \u25a2, 1\u00bd to 2, , tablespoons, , ghee, , or butter or oil, \u25a2, \u00be, , teaspoon, , cumin seeds, , (jeera), \u25a2, 1, , dried red chilli, , (broken, optional), \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , ginger chopped, , (or 1 clove garlic or both), \u25a2, 1 to 2, , green chilies, , (chopped, substitute \u00bd tsp chili powder), \u25a2, 1, , pinch, , hing, , (asafoetida, optional), \u25a2, \u215b to \u00bc, , teaspoon, , turmeric, \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , salt, , (adjust to taste), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , kasuri methi, , (optional, dried fenugreek leaves), \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , Lemon juice, , (or 1 tsp amchur / dry mango powder), , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Carol, , , , , , December 8, 2024 12:26 pm, , , , , , A friend at work sent me your recipe link to try out.

Your recipes are a big hit with my family. Years ago I was intimidated to cook but you make everything look so simple. I have made a large batch of ghee today following your recipe. My neighbor generously shared fresh curry which I added to the ghee. They got fried nicely and I stored them in a glass bottle to use up the next few weeks. The ghee has gotten a great curry leaf flavor. I also made this dal palak with the ghee and my house smells amazing. Tonight I will be making your curry leaf powder to use up the bulk of leaves.

Please try again., , , , , , , , , Instructions: ., , 1. Add half cup dal to a sauce pan or pressure cooker and rinse it well thrice. I use toor dal and moong dal in equal proportions. You can use any kind of dal you prefer including red lentils. The taste of dal palak enhances with the use of moong dal, so even a little is enough for that great taste. You can optionally add a deseeded and chopped small tomato., , , , If you do not own a cooker, , you can soak the dal for about 15 mins to 1 hour to quicken the process. Bring the water to a rolling boil and reduce to medium, cook until soft and mushy. Add more hot water as you cook., , 2. Pour 1\u00bc cups water to the cooker and secure the lid. Pressure cook on a medium heat for 2 whistles., , , , 3. While the lentils cook, clean 100 grams spinach and rinse it well a few times. I usually spray some vinegar and sprinkle salt or baking soda over the leaves first. Leave them for 5 to 10 mins. Then rinse them off in a large pot a few times. This gets rid of all the pesticide residue and any bugs. Drain the leaves to a colander. When the water drains, chop them. You will need 2 cups chopped spinach. Also chop 1 to 2 green chilies and some ginger garlic. We need 1 tsp of the same., , 4. When the pressure releases naturally, open the cooker and mash the dal slightly. You can skip mashing if you like to retain the same texture. It must be soft cooked and not remain al dente., , , , Tempering, , 5. Heat 1\u00bd to 2 tablespoons ghee in a kadai/ pan. To keep the recipe vegan, you can use oil. When the ghee turns hot, add \u00be teaspoon cumin seeds and 1 to 2 broken dried red chilies (optional)., , , , 6. When the seeds begin to crackle, add 1 teaspoon chopped ginger garlic and 1 to 2 chopped green chilies. We are not using red chilli powder in this recipe so use enough green chilies for the heat. Saute just for a minute and add 1/8 teaspoon hing., , , , 7. Add 2 cups chopped spinach/ palak. You can use more or less to suit your taste., , , , 8. Saute for 3 to 4 mins on a medium heat until the spinach wilts and cooks through., , , , 9. Add the cooked dal, 1/8 teaspoon turmeric and half teaspoon salt. Mix well., , , , 10. Pour water if your dal is too thick, to bring the dal palak to a consistency. Cook until the dal begins to bubble. Palak doesn\u2019t require long cooking, so a few minutes will be good enough. If you like to use amchur you can add it at this stage. I prefer lemon juice so I don\u2019t add it., , , , 11. When it reaches the desired consistency, stir in the crushed kasuri methi. Turn off the stove. Taste test and add more salt. When the dal palak cools down slightly, squeeze in lemon juice if you have not used amchur. Do not squeeze the lemon over boiling hot dal. If you have used oil for tempering, add a tbsp of ghee now., , , , Serve dal palak with rice or roti or chapati. If want you may make a special tadka following the steps below., , , , Special Tadka, , 12. On a medium flame, heat a tablespoon of ghee or oil in a small tadka pan. Add 1 sliced garlic and 1 broken red chili., , , , 13. Add a large pinch of mustard seed and \u00bc teaspoon cumin seeds., , , , 14. When the mustard seeds begins to splutter, turn off the heat and add the curry leaves (pat dry first). Add hing and \u00bc teaspoon red chili powder. Note it is very important to turn off the heat first., , , , 15. Mix well., , , , Pour over the dal palak. This spinach dal is made using second recipe (below).

Sprinkle lemon juice and serve with rice or roti. If you want to make a special tadka, check the special tadka section in the post., Special Tadka (optional for extra flavor), \u25a2, Add 1 to 1\u00bd tablespoon ghee/butter to a small tadka pan and heat on a medium flame. Stir in a large pinch of mustard seed, \u00bc teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 broken dried red chili and 1 sliced garlic., \u25a2, When the mustard seeds begins to splutter, turn off the stove and add 8 to 10 curry leaves (pat dry first). Stir in a pinch of hing and \u00bc teaspoon red chili powder. Mix well and pour over the spinach dal., Instant Pot Spinach Dal, \u25a2, Press SAUTE button on the Instant pot and pour ghee to the steel insert. Add cumin, dried red chilies, garlic/ginger and green chilies. When the cumin seeds splutter, add tomatoes (optional) and saute for 1 minute., \u25a2, Add dal, turmeric and salt. If you prefer to use chilli powder as a substitute to green chilies, add it now., \u25a2, Press CANCEL button. Pour 1\u00bd cups water and deglaze with a spatula to release any bits of food stuck at the bottom. Optionally you can also place a trivet and keep your rice bowl over it & cover., \u25a2, Secure the Instant pot with the lid. Press PRESSURE COOK button (high pressure) and set the timer to 10 mins. Let the pressure release naturally for at least, 15 mins. Release the rest manually., \u25a2, Add the chopped spinach to the dal and give a good mix. Press SAUTE button and cook for 2 mins until the spinach wilts and softens., \u25a2, Press CANCEL and sprinkle kasuri methi (optional). Cover the IP until you serve. This helps spinach to cook completely with the residual heat in the IP., \u25a2, Taste test and add more salt if needed. When the spinach dal cools a bit, add lemon juice. Serve with rice or roti., , , Notes, , For the dal, you can use toor dal/split pigeon peas, masoor dal/red lentils or a combination like 50/50 \u2013, \u00bc cup toor dal & \u00bc cup moong/ yellow lentils/red lentils., , , , Video, , , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Dal Palak, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 184, , Calories from Fat 45, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 5g, 8%, Saturated Fat 3g, 19%, Cholesterol, 12mg, 4%, Sodium, 77mg, 3%, Potassium, 579mg, 17%, Carbohydrates, 24g, 8%, Fiber 11g, 46%, Sugar 3g, 3%, Protein, 9g, 18%, , , Vitamin A, 2360IU, 47%, Vitamin C, 36mg, 44%, Calcium, 47mg, 5%, Iron, 3.9mg, 22%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , , Recipe 2, , How to make Spinach Dal with Tomatoes, , , 1.

Toor dal actually has a mild sweet flavor similar to red lentils and they are not bland unless they are too old sitting in the shelves/stores for too long. Also pls use Indian toor dal, not from other countries like Africa because they have a different flavor profile. The dal palak itself should taste very delicious with most of the flavors coming from dal and spinach. You don\u2019t need a tadka too. Give another try using good quality dal and palak (don\u2019t use mature spinach, use baby or young spinach). Next time, pls don\u2019t burn the tadka and that takes your spinach dal to the next level. Hope this helps, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Liliana, , , , , , Reply to, swasthi, , , , April 10, 2025 12:54 pm, , , , , , Thank you very much  for the tips, Swasthi <3 I will follow your tips next time. And I will try to find another type of lentils to try different combinations., , For now, upon reheating the leftover portions, I went a bit braver with spices: fenugreek, jeera and mustard seeds, as well as lemon juice. I think they really opened up the taste. Also, the lentils got more mushy and creamy, which made them even tastier., I think I am slowly getting there.

I love that you didn\u2019t ask me to chop and saute the onions, like every other Indian recipe. You don\u2019t need onions every single time and heating the oil for that long is a no for my family.

Did you ever freeze it? How would you reheat? Any advice?, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Wendy, , , , January 25, 2025 4:08 am, , , , , , Thanks Wendy. That\u2019s nice to know! Dal dishes are best eaten fresh so I don\u2019t freeze. Though it keeps good frozen, it is believed to cause bloating issues if eaten often (according to ayurveda). But you may freeze in glass containers and reheat on the stovetop until bubbling hot. Omit the additional tadka when you first make and do it after reheating. This refreshes your dal palak. Hope this helps, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Edith, , , , , , January 15, 2025 1:21 pm, , , , , , I will be using 1 cup red lentils to make this dal spinach. Can I use a can of chickpea too?

I use lesser chili because I have 2 preschoolers. My husband loves it with your mango pickle which I made during last summer.

This staple Indian lentil preparation can also me made with, Chana Dal, which is split and hulled bengal gram., , Dal Tadka can be made with a variety of lentil types.

That said, there are some tips I\u2019ve shared below:, , Order of, , Preparation, : Be sure to cook the lentils first, and then prepare the tadka right before serving.

So keep this point in mind., , Tomatoes, : In the North Indian style, I have added tomatoes to give the lentils a nice tang. If you do not have tomatoes, then add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of lemon juice when the lentils are cooked. You can also use drained canned diced tomatoes if you need \u2013 just be sure to chop them finely before adding., , Tempering Oil:, You can temper the spices and herbs in either ghee or a neutral flavored oil. In this recipe I have used sunflower oil, : If possible, , Consistency, : The consistency of the cooked dal is neither thick nor thin, but medium. If you prefer, you can opt for a slightly thicker consistency by adding less water, or a thin dal consistency by adding more water., , Soaking Lentils, : If you soak the lentils for 30 to 40 minutes before cooking them, the cooking time will be faster.

        "Methi Dal": "Ingredients: fenugreek leaves, tomatoes, onions, chilies, garlic, turmeric and water to a pressure cooker., , Pressure cook until soft and then make a tadka/tempering with whole and ground spices like the way I have shown in this, Dal Tadka, recipe. This is one way I make when I\u2019m short of time., , , , \u00bc\u00a0teaspoon\u00a0mustard seeds, , \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon\u00a0cumin seeds\u00a0/ jeera, , 2\u00a0garlic cloves\u00a0crushed, , 1\u00a0dried red chili\u00a0broken (optional), , 1\u00a0sprig\u00a0curry leaves\u00a0(optional), , 1\u00a0pinch\u00a0hing\u00a0(asafoetida, optional), , , , , 6. Heat 1\u00bd\u00a0tablespoon, Ghee, or oil in a pan. Add mustard, cumin seeds & red chilies. When they begin to splutter, add curry leaves and hing. I don\u2019t use red chili powder so I add extra green chilies here., , , , 7. Add hing and then methi leaves., , , , 8. Saute methi leaves until they completely wilt. Add \u00bc teaspoon red chili powder if you want. I don\u2019t use. Turn off the heat., , , , 9. Your dal should be soft cooked and mushy., , , , 9. Mash the tomatoes gently., , , , 10. Add the methi tempering and salt., , , , 11. Mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 mins. Taste test and add more salt. If you want add \u00bc\u00a0teaspoon garam masala at this stage. To make it more hot, simply mash the green chilies in your methi dal. Cool down a bit and add lemon juice., , , , Serve methi dal hot with rice, chapati or parathas., , , , Pro Tips, , , There is a huge difference between the Methi dal made with & without red chili powder. We are partial here and love the dal made without red chili powder. I use enough green chilies to provide the heat. But if you can\u2019t eat green chilies due to diet reasons, simply use red chili powder., , You can add a small chopped onion along with tomatoes. It adds sweet tones and reduces the bitterness in methi leaves., , 4 cups methi leaves is the standard I use for every cup of dal. You can use more but make sure you cook the leaves well or even pressure cook. While consuming large amounts of methi leaves it is ideal to pressure cook them or cook for longer time for easier digestion else it can cause acidity., , , , Related Recipes, , Dal Fry Recipe (R..., , , Dal Tadka Recipe, , , Dal Palak (Spinac..., , , Mamidikaya Pappu ..., , , Aloo Methi | Pota..., , , Methi Paratha Rec..., , , , , Methi Dal Recipe first published in May 2015.

Not too spicy and hot but the subtle flavors of methi and curry leaves makes this dish taste delicious & flavorful., , We don\u2019t like our everyday dal with tons of hot spices and that\u2019s how this Methi dal is made. It\u2019s a lovely change from all those spicy & greasy Indian dishes. It is toddler/ kids friendly too., , If you want you may increase the spice levels or even use garam masala if you want., , If you love experimenting your foods with new flavors you can also make this in Andhra Style. It is known as Menthi Kura Pappu & uses tamarind to impart tang and this actually cuts down the bitter flavor of the methi leaves., , At home we don\u2019t appreciate the tamarind flavors much so I use a generous amount of lemon juice while serving. A lot of times I also use the unripe green mango or dried mango (dehydrated unripe mango pieces) to impart the tangy flavors. It somewhat tastes like methi in, Mango Pappu, ., , , , For more, Dal recipes, ,, Dal fry, Dal palak, Moong dal recipe, Chana dal recipe, Tomato pappu, Gongura pappu, , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Methi Dal (Stepwise Photos), , Preparation, , 1.

The fresh and dried methi leaves have very different flavors.The dried leaves have a very strong flavor. For half cup dal you can try adding 3 to 4 tbsps of kasuri methi. But it doesn\u2019t need cooking. So just add it to the tempering towards the end and then pour all of this to the dal. Just simmer for 1 to mins.

        "Dal Makhani": "Ingredients: , Serve this Dal Makhani with fluffy, Basmati Rice, , , Jeera Rice, , garlic, Butter naan, , , Tandoori Roti, , , Chapati, or roti., , It is believed that Dal Makhani was invented by Kundal Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral, who were Punjabi Hindu immigrants from Peshawar. After a roaring success with their, Butter Chicken, , they were keen to come-up with a vegetarian version., , Since urad dal was a popular staple among the Punjabis, they made the dish using the same. Dal Makhani was first served in their own restaurant named Moti Mahal in Delhi., , Later as years passed by, it became popular and now it is one of the most ordered special lentil dish across India. Others were inspired with this and came up with similar specials like Dal Bhukara and Dal Maharani., , , Lentils, \u2013 I use black lentils (whole urad dal) and red kidney beans (rajma). For 1 cup urad dal I use \u00bc cup rajma. Many people also add a small quantity of chana dal (Bengal gram) for texture. If you prefer you can use 2 tbsp in the recipe or may substitute rajma with chana dal., , Cream, \u2013 Cooking cream, whipping cream, heavy cream or homemade malai (cream) works well. If using homemade malai, then blend it well in a small blender jar until smooth. Then transfer this to a small cup and stir together a few tbsps of dal makhani. Then pour that to the pot. This way cream will not split., , Kasuri methi or dried fenugreek leaves, \u2013 A small quantity of kasuri methi makes a huge difference here. However if you do not have you may skip it. There is no substitute., , Similar recipes, Brown Lentils, (Whole Masoor Dal), Red Lentil Curry, Kadhi Pakora, Chole recipe, Chana masala, Rajma recipe, , , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Dal Makhani (Stepwise Photos), , 1., Soaking lentils, : Add 1 cup urad dal (black lentils) & \u00bc cup rajma (red kidney beans) to a large pot and rinse thoroughly a few times. Drain the water and pour 3 to 4 cups fresh water. Soak them for at least 6 to 8 hours. To speed up the soaking process you may pour boiling water and soak for 4 hours., , , , 2., Cooking lentils, : After they are soaked well, drain the water and pour 4 cups fresh water. Pressure cook on a medium heat for 10 whistles. It takes about 35 to 40 mins. If using an Instant pot pressure cook for 20 mins. If cooking in a pot add more water as required and cook until they become tender. This is how they look after pressure cooking them., , , , 3., Check if cooked well, : When the pressure releases naturally, open the lid and check if the dal is well cooked. Both rajma and urad dal have to be softened. Press down a rajma and few urad dal in between your thumb and fore finger. They should get mashed very well easily. They should not be aldente or even slightly hard., , , , If they are under-cooked, add half cup more hot water and cook for a little longer about 3 to 4 whistles., , While the dal cooks, chop 1 medium onion finely. Make 1 tablespoon of ginger garlic paste. Chop 210 grams of tomatoes (about 1 heaped cup chopped). Puree in a blender. We will need 1 cup tomato puree here. Measure it and keep aside., , Make Masala, , 4.Heat a heavy bottom pot. Add 1\u00bd tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon ghee. If using whole spices (optional), add 1 bay leaf, 1 black cardamom and 2 green cardamoms. Saute them for half a minute. Then add 1 medium onion finely chopped. Saute until golden or light brown., , , , 5.Then stir in 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste. Saute for 1 minute until the raw smell disappears., , , , 6.Next add 1 cup tomato puree (210 grams) and saute for a while., , , , 7.Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, \u00be to 1\u00bd teaspoon red chilli powder and 1 teaspoon garam masala. Adjust the chilli powder to suit your taste. I use 1\u00bd teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder. If you are using hot chilli powder then cut down . I used this, punjabi garam masala, . Please ensure you use a good one., , , , 8.Saute until the masala cooks well and turns thick. The masala begins to smell good when done., , , , 9.Mash the cooked lentils slightly and transfer to the pot along with the stock. Stir well and add 1 cup hot boiling water., , , , Slow Cook Dal, , 10.Stir and continue to cook on the lowest possible heat stirring often to avoid burning. After 60 mins, you will need to add another half cup hot water each time and cook until the dal thickens. I add about 2 cups water in total (1 + \u00bd + \u00bd)., , , , 11.Continue to cook on a low flame for a total of 80 mins stirring every now and then to prevent the dal sticking at the bottom., , , , 12.Taste the dal makhani. Add more salt as needed. Take \u00bd teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and crush it in between your palms. Then add it. This brings out the flavor., , , , 13. Stir in \u00bc cup cream and continue to cook for another 10 mins. If you are making ahead for later use, you may add cream, butter and kasuri methi when you reheat it. So just make the dal makhani without all of the 3, cool and refrigerate or freeze. When you reheat add all of them., , , , 14.This was the consistency I got after 90 mins of total cooking. Thick, creamy & flavorful. Then stir in 1\u00bd tablespoon butter. Turn off the heat., , , , Smoke Dal Makhani (Optional), , Please avoid this if you are a novice cook., Dal makhani tastes good even without this step., , Place a tall steel cup or bowl in the center of the pot. Ensure it doesn\u2019t get submerged in the dal. Hold a piece of wood coal with a tong over direct fire. For extra safety use a stove lighter or a candle instead of a larger source of fire., , After a few minutes, the coal will turn red & hot. Then carefully place it inside the cup and pour \u00bc teaspoon of ghee. You will immediately see fumes emitted by the coal. Cover the pot immediately and leave for 3 to 4 mins., , , , You may repeat pouring another \u00bc teaspoon ghee to smoke for longer. Smoking too long will leave a very strong flavor so 3 to 4 mins is good enough for our taste., , Dal makhani goes very well with Indian breads like, butter naan, , roti, , tandoori roti, and even with, jeera rice, or plain, Basmati Rice, . Garnish dal makhani with cream or butter before serving., , , , Pro Tips, , Soak black lentils and rajma, for at least 8 hours. Well soaked lentils cook up to a creamy texture which is very important to make a delicious dal makhani. To speed up the soaking process, you may soak them in boiling hot water for 4 hours., , Precook the lentils well, before adding them to the makhani masala. Even slightly undercooked dal will not work well here., , Butter is the key ingredient, to make a flavorful dal makhani. Be generous & use a good amount of butter. In India, cultured butter is used which actually brings an amazing flavor. You can also use the regular butter like the way I did., , But be generous & add a good amount of it. If you are on a low fat diet, cut down your portion size instead of making a low fat dal makhani., , I prefer to use half butter and half ghee for cooking the masala as using only butter burns quickly. You may use one for the other., , Slow cooking lentils on a lowest heat, brings out the best flavors. Dal makhani served in restaurants is so much flavorful as the lentils are cooked overnight or whole day on slow fire., , Without simmering you won\u2019t really get the essential flavors in your dal makhani. I suggest simmering for at least 90 mins after adding the cooked lentils to the tempering or masala., , More Tips, , Spices are used, in minimum quantities here to keep the flavor of slow cooked black lentils dominant. Most standard Indian restaurants use whole spices like bay leaf, black cardamoms & green cardamoms especially in the tempering., , These spices make a huge difference as they release a unique aroma to the dal when slow cooked for several hours. However you may use either whole spices or ground spices or a mix of both. More in the recipe notes., , Smoking dal makhani, \u2013 Traditionally made dish is cooked on coal fire for long hours which naturally imparts a smoky aroma to the dish. To some extent the smoky flavor can be recreated at home by smoking the final dish. This step is optional. I have shown it in detail in the video you may take a look., , If you prefer to smoke your dal makhani, ensure you use wood coal that has no additives or fuel added to it. Many people also add liquid smoke to the dish to get that strong flavor., , Faqs, , , Dal makhani is made with whole black lentils, unsalted butter, spices, tomatoes, onions, herbs & cream., , , Which dal is used in dal makhani?, , Sabut urad dal is used in dal makhani. It is also known as black lentils or black gram., , , How to make dal makhani without onion?, , Just skip the onions and follow the recipe as is. There will be no change in the taste., , , Can I skip spices?, , Though the major flavors come from slow cooking the lentils, a small quantity of whole or ground spices do elevate the flavors of the dish. So for best flavors, use the spices as mentioned., , , How to freeze dal makhani, ?, , For best flavors, cool it immediately, transfer to smaller freezer safe glass bowls & freeze within 2 hours of cooking. This way the flavors are retained to a maximum extent. When you prefer to use, thaw it in the fridge overnight or for 10 to 12 hours., , , How to reheat?, , To reheat, transfer to a pot and cook until bubbling & very hot. If needed pour little water. Alternately transfer to a steel bowl and reheat in instant pot (PIP) on a high pressure for 3 to 4 mins. I do not add any water for reheating in the IP., , , , How to double the recipe?, To double this recipe, , , Related Recipes, , Brown Lentils, , , Red Lentil Curry, , , Rajma Recipe | Ra..., , , Chole Recipe (Pun..., , , Dal Fry Recipe (R..., , , Chana Dal Recipe ..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Dal Makhani Recipe (Restaurant Style), , , 4.99, from, 589, votes, , , , Dal makhani is a delicious, rich & creamy dish made with black lentils, spices, To Pressure Cook, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , whole black lentil, , (200 grams black gram \u2013 whole urad dal), \u25a2, \u00bc, , cup, , rajma, , (red kidney beans) (optional), \u25a2, 4, , cups, , water, , for pressure cooking \u2013 more for pot, To Temper/ Masala, \u25a2, 3, , tablespoons, , unsalted butter, , (divided \u2013 1 \u00bd tbsp + 1 \u00bd tbsp), \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , ghee, \u25a2, 1, , medium, , onion, , finely  chopped (65 grams), \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , ginger garlic paste, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , tomato puree, , (210 grams), \u25a2, 2, , teaspoons, , salt, , (adjust to taste), \u25a2, \u00be to 1\u00bd, , teaspoons, , red chilli powder, , (adjust to taste) (I use 1\u00bd), \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , garam masala, , (use fragrant spice blend), \u25a2, 2, , cups, , water, , (preferably boiling hot), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , kasuri methi, , (dried fenugreek leaves) (optional), \u25a2, \u00bc, , cup, , cream, , (more for garnish, heavy cream, whipping cream), Whole Spices (optional), \u25a2, 1, , bay leaf, , (optional), \u25a2, 2, , green cardamoms, , (optional), \u25a2, 1, , black cardamom, , (optional), , , You may use whole spices in tempering \u2013 1 black cardamom, 2 to 3 green cardamoms and 1 bay leaf., , You can use bottled or homemade tomato puree.

The dal is cooked in an instapot for 20 minutes with 4 cups of water and I  add 1 cup boiling at when combining with the masala and and another half cup at the 60 minute mark.

You either used a different kind of black lentils or they are too old, sitting in the shelves/stores for many years. Black lentils used in this recipe is the Indian variety and are labelled as Black urad dal. I assume you tried this recipe with a different kind of black lentils (like beluga) which are not suitable for this recipe. Because urad dal upon cooking well turns thick and has a viscous texture. As you cook longer (adding more water), it keeps getting thicker and thicker. If that doesn\u2019t happen it means either the lentils are not black urad or they are too old. Some stores also carry urad dal from Africa which are not great for this recipe as they won\u2019t thicken. Please buy them from a Indian grocery and make sure they are from India.

This is not a tomato based dish so you may omit if you can\u2019t eat them. or You may substitute with half cup yogurt. Mash 2 to 3 tbsps cooked urad dal in a bowl and whisk with yogurt very well until smooth. Add that to the onion, ginger garlic tempering and cook first until thick, before adding the rest of the urad dal and rajma. The other option is to use lemon juice at the time of serving.

Dhal or, Dal refers to lentils, and Makhani translates to buttery. Dal Makhani literally means Buttery dal., , Traditionally Dal Makhani is prepared by cooking lentils on wood/coal fire for several hours. This slow cooking for prolonged hours yield a creamy, thick and best tasting buttery dal., , , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , For best results follow the step-by-step photos above the recipe card, , , , , , Prep Time, 10, minutes, , minutes, Cook Time, 2, hours, , hours, Soaking time, 8, hours, , hours, Total Time, 10, hours, , hours, , 10, minutes, , minutes, , Servings, 4, , Author, Swasthi, , , , Preparation, \u25a2, Add urad dal and rajma to a large pot and rinse them well a few times. Drain the water and soak them in 3 to 4 cups of water for 7 to 8 hours. To reduce the soaking time, you may soak them in boiling hot water for 4 to 5 hours., \u25a2, Later drain the water and rinse them well., How to make Dal Makhani, \u25a2, Pour 4 cups fresh water and pressure cook for 10 whistles on a medium heat. You can also cook in a pot until soft and tender adding more water as needed. If cooking in instant pot, pressure cook on high pressure for 20 mins., \u25a2, Both urad dal and rajma must cook to very soft. When mashed with a spoon the dal and rajma must be soft and get mashed well easily.  If not then pour another half cup hot water and continue to cook for another 3 to 4 whistles on a medium heat., \u25a2, Heat a heavy bottom pot with butter & ghee. If using whole spices, add them and saute for half a minute. Then add onions and fry until they turn golden., \u25a2, Stir in ginger garlic paste and saute for 1 minute until the raw smell goes away., \u25a2, Then transfer tomato puree and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until thick., \u25a2, Add salt, chilli powder & garam masala.   Saute well until the masala smells good and turns thick., \u25a2, Mash the cooked urad dal slightly and pour it along with the stock. Pour another 1 cup hot boiling water & mix., \u25a2, Cook on a low flame until the dal thickens stirring often in between to prevent burning the bottom. After 60 mins, the dal thickens., \u25a2, Add another \u00bd to 1 cup hot boiling water and continue to cook until thick. This takes another 30 mins. Totally cook for about 90 mins from the time you added the cooked dal to the pot., \u25a2, Then add kasuri methi and pour cream. Stir and cook again for 6 to 8 mins until it becomes thick and creamy., \u25a2, Taste and add more salt if needed. Add butter and mix well., Dhungar \u2013 Smoking (optional), \u25a2, Place a small piece of foil or a tall steel cup on the dal makhani. Hold 1 to 2 inch piece of natural wood charcoal with a tong and burn it on direct fire until red hot. Then place it on the foil kept over dal or in the steel cup., \u25a2, Quickly pour \u00bc tsp ghee on the hot coal. Immediately cover the pot and allow to smoke for 3 to 4 mins. For stronger flavor, add another \u00bc tsp ghee on the coal and repeat the smoking., \u25a2, Garnish dal makhani with butter or cream & serve with fluffy, Basmati rice, or naan., Instant Pot Dal Makhani, \u25a2, Press SAUTE button on the Instant pot. Add ghee and butter to the steel insert., \u25a2, Once the butter melts, add onions and saute until transparent. Add ginger garlic paste and saute for 30 seconds., \u25a2, Pour the tomato puree, red chilli powder & garam masala. Saute for 3 to 5 mins., \u25a2, Drain the water from the lentils and add them. Pour 3 cups water and deglaze the pot by scrubbing the bottom with a wooden spatula., \u25a2, Press CANCEL button. Secure the Instant pot with the lid. Position the steam release handle to sealing., \u25a2, Press PRESSURE COOK button and set the timer to 30 mins., \u25a2, When the IP finishes it will beep. Wait for the pressure to release naturally., \u25a2, Open the lid.  You will see the dal being runny at this stage.  Add salt & slightly mash the urad dal, not rajma., \u25a2, Press SAUTE button. Adjust the setting to LOW by pressing the saute button twice., \u25a2, Cook further stirring often until thick. When most of the moisture evaporates, dal turns thicker. Optional \u2013 I prefer to add 1 more cup of hot water in 2 batches, \u00bd cup each time. Cook further until really creamy and thick., \u25a2, Then add cream and kasuri methi.

        "Dal Bati Churma": "Ingredients: wheat flour, semolina and lentils, such a different and yummy main course gets ready. Bati is even easier than making chapati as no fear of rolling it thin and round. Plus you are hands-free when the batis goes in the oven/air fryer., , , , Quarantine Fever On!, , Day 3 of the lockdown due to coronavirus! Everybody is at home! No outings, no outside food, no office, no work. In such a situation, it becomes imperative for me to serve varieties in food so as not to add to the boredom. But resources are also limited. So, I try to twist the regular food only and try varieties using my pantry items only. Like, instead of dal and rice, make Dosa sambhar, Quesadillas or pizza in place of chapati and so on., , Every day, I am trying to make at least one meal that children would look forward to. Their list is long and so is the quarantine period. Let us see, how much I can cater to their demands., , Anyways, keeping in tune with their demands, I today made Rajasthan Special, Dal Bati Churma. And it was super liked by all three of them. Now, there's nothing new in this recipe as I have been making these since ages but the only thing is that today I made it after a long gap. I have made it umpteen times and it was very much in my list for my blog posts but somehow couldn't. So, when made today it was the perfect time to write the post also. You can easily make this using the regular flour and lentils in your kitchen. The best thing was that I made this heavy-duty food in a\u00a0 low-calorie form and no change in taste., , , Thanksgiving, , As for the recipe, who can share it the best than anyone living in Rajasthan only? Therefore, years back, I too turned to my aunt (bua) Anju Jain, who lives in Jodhpur, for this recipe. Thus, this recipe comes directly from the horse's mouth!, , As everybody is at home 24 hours without anything to do, so I am worried about their health too. And Bati and Churma, when fried gather so much fat. I chose this menu as I make everything in the air fryer only. In fact, Bati and Churma made in the air fryer is much better than that is deep-fried. The Churma is so light that you can easily eat without having any feeling of heaviness on the tummy.,  Instructions: , Traditionally, Dal Bati Churma is a delicacy of Rajasthani cuisine and is a very rich food in the sense that it is made with a lot of ghee. But times have changed and everyone is calorie-conscious. If you had been avoiding Dal Bati Churma as it's too heavy on digestion then try this. The otherwise heavy-duty Dal-Bati-Churma is made without excess oil in an air fryer which not only reduces the calories but makes the food tasty and with reduced efforts., , This is a, Jain recipe, , made without using any onion or garlic., , This is a long post as it has 3 recipes, so take it easy!, , , Plain As Well Stuffed Bati, , Daal Baati Churma is a, , , , What is Bati?, , what is meant by Bati?, , Bati is a ball of dough that is either fried or cooked on firewood. For chapati, we roll the ball but when it is cooked as it is without rolling then it is called Bati. As it is thick dough only it is cooked on low flame so that it gets cooked properly from inside too. This is the reason, a lot of ghee is added to the flour while kneading it., , Once cooked, Bati is hard and cannot be cut with a spoon but it should be such that it can be easily crushed with hand., , , , How to Make, , A.\u00a0 Dal, , There is no fixed Dal that goes with Bati. The most preferred one is mixed dal where 4 to 5 different lentils are mixed. Some people like to make it with just 2 lentils, Urad-Chana. Whereas, some others prefer only Urad dal. So, basically, urad dal is a must. I also make mixed dal and take 4 lentils, namely, Urad, Chana, Moong Chhilka and Arhar. This combination gives the best dal. I take all the dals in equal quantity but add Urad dal almost double. Like if all the 3 lentils are 1/4 cup each then I would take 1/2 cup Urad dal., , So, the ratio of lentils is:, , , Tuar dal: Chana Dal: Moong Chilka: Urad Dal, , 1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 :\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 :\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2, , , , As mentioned earlier, , this recipe of Dal is a Jain recipe and thus is made without any onion or garlic., This dal tastes best not only because of this awesome combination but because of tomatoes, ginger, green chillies and green coriander added to it. I strongly recommend you that do not make this dal in the absence of these., , , , B. Bati, , I make Bati with wheat flour and semolina. Traditionally, a lot of ghee is added to this flour mix so that it remains soft from inside once baked. But I have reduced ghee and replaced it with curd., , My Bati uses less ghee and no baking powder. I have never felt the need to use baking powder. It comes out well without it. While kneading,\u00a0 just mix both the flours, ghee, curd and water and form a rough dough. Then cover it and leave it for half an hour or so. After half an hour, knead it again till I get a smooth dough. This resting time reduces\u00a0 my efforts and improves the texture of the dough., , Ratio Of Wheat Flour And Semolina: I take the two flours in the given ratio, , Wheat flour\u00a0 : Semolina, , 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1, , This means that for every 2 parts of wheat flour,\u00a0 add 1 part semolina., , , Also, the semolina is of fine variety, which is also called Chiroti Rawa. If you have ordinary semolina then just grind it for 30 seconds or so and your fine semolina will be ready., , I make 2 types of Bati, plain and stuffed, as my elder son eats only stuffed ones. For stuffing I use peas. Bati stuffed with peas taste more or less like Matar Kachori., , And then, I make Bati in the air fryer. Alternatively, you can bake these in the oven or make these in appe pan also., , , , , C. Churma, , , For making Churma, just take semolina, add ghee to it and knead into a dough. Do not keep the dough very tight initially., , Keep this dough for at least half an hour. during this time the dough tightens as semolina swells., , Take a little dough, press it between fingers and palm. Basically, make muthiya type., , Put these in the air fryer for half an hour or till these get golden. Do not make these too thick else they will take longer to cook and also will remain uncooked from inside., , Once cooked fully, let it cool down fully., , When cooled, crush these roughly and put them in the grinder. Just 5 to 7 seconds in the grinder and you get a coarsely grounded semolina mixture., , Add powdered sugar. That's it!, , You may add green cardamom powder, dry fruits etc, but we all prefer it plain only. The quantity of powdered sugar depends on your choice but ideally when added in the ratio of 2: 1, gives perfect sweetness. This means, measure the powdered semolina mixture and then add just half of this., , , , Grounded Semolina Mixture: Powdered Sugar, , 2\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01, , , , , , , Serving Suggestions, , The correct way to serve Dal Bati is to lightly crush the Batis and soak them in a bowl of melted ghee. And then these are eaten with Dal put on them. Some people like to mix in it Churma also. But that is a personal choice as to have savory and sweet together or not. If not, then Churma is eaten as a side dish or in the end like a sweet., , But nowadays, as everybody is diet conscious, so I serve melted ghee and Bati separately and people can have it according to their choice., , , , , , , , Step By Step Photos, , A. For Dal, , , Take all 4 lentils. Wash and soak these for half an hour., , , , , , , Add salt, turmeric, green chilli, and water to rinsed dal and pressure cook it at medium-high flame., , After the first whistle, lower the flame and turn off the flame after 3 to 4 minutes., , , Tip: Do not overcook the lentils., , , , , , In a kadhai, add ghee.

        "Litti Chokha": "Ingredients: its much easier than making stuffed parathas. You just stuff the filling in the dough, make a round again and bake all these together or maybe in 2 or 3 lots. When baked in air fryer or oven, then it is so easy. No hassle of rolling it or cooking it on skillet one by one., , Similarly, making Chokha is easy. The only time consuming thing is to roast brinjal. While the brinjal gets roasted, you chop other condiments like ginger, green coriander, green chillies etc., , , , Gluten-Free Litti, , Litti, usually is made with wheat flour. The flour is kneaded and then stuffed with Sattu. As I have mentioned earlier posts too, that Sorghum or Jowar flour resembles wheat flour a lot. Amongst all the millets, it is the nearest to wheat in terms of looks as well as taste. So, I decided to try making Litti with Jowar flour only and it worked just beautifully. I have read that you can make Litti with Bajra flour (Pearl millet) too, but have not tried that so can't comment., , , , A Little About Sorghum Flour, , You can read here about this, wonder millet, ., , A Little About Sattu, , You can read here about this, magical ingredient here, ., , , , Difference Between Litti And Bati, , Litti and Bati, looks are more or less similar and having a look at them its not easy to say, whether its a Litti or a Bati. They may look the same but the inside story is totally different. You name Bati and you get transported to the colourful land of Rajasthan and Litti takes you to the simple and sober Bihar., , There is just one similarity between the two, in fact, two. First is that the base of both these is whole wheat flour. You have to knead the flour, either make Bati or Litti. The second similarity is that both of these are cooked on charcoal, clay oven or in ovens, nowadays. And that's it! The similarity ends here., , Now, let's see how Litti and Bati are different from each other:, , , Bati is a Rajasthani delicacy, whereas Litti is from the Bihari cuisine., , Bati is eaten with Dal, Churma and lots of ghee. Whereas Litti is eaten with Chokha, a curry vegetable may or may not accompany it., , Bati is plain or stuffed with peas or lentils. Whereas, Litti is always stuffed with Sattu., , , , , Tips To Make Good Litti Chokha, , , Before roasting brinjal, insert some small garlic pieces here and there in the brinjal. For this, make a cut and insert garlic through it. Then roast garlic. This way, even garlic will get roasted and its flavour will be very well embedded in the brinjal. A super tip, which you can use while making Baingan Ka Bharta too., , Roast brinjal on medium flame so that it gets roasted well from inside too. The smoky flavour of brinjal in Chokha tastes great., , Add chopped onions to the Sattu filling only if you are going to consume it within few hours.

        "Black Bean curry": "Ingredients: , , , Plant-based spread, : This can be replaced with vegan margarine, vegan butter, or (if not vegan) some ghee or butter. Whatever you use, make sure it\u2019s a spread that tastes good as it really imparts a lot of flavor. I don\u2019t recommend using oil instead, but if you don\u2019t have anything else to hand you can use coconut oil., , Cumin seeds:, Don\u2019t like them? Leave them out. Don\u2019t have any? Either leave out or add one teaspoon of ground cumin with the cayenne, ground coriander and garam masala later on in the recipe., , Onion:, Don\u2019t leave this out! If you don\u2019t have any white onion to hand it\u2019s fine to use another similar type e.g. red onion, shallots, the white part of spring onions, as long as you use roughly the same amount (about one cup chopped)., , Garlic:, Don\u2019t leave this out and don\u2019t substitute with ground garlic, which tastes quite different. The cloves in this recipe need to be crushed, if you don\u2019t have a garlic crusher you can just chop them finely instead., , Tomatoes:, You need to use fresh raw tomatoes in this recipe, canned tomatoes won\u2019t do. You can use any type of ripe red tomatoes., , Cayenne pepper, : This is optional so if you don\u2019t like spice just leave it out. One quarter teaspoon will give a mild amount of spice whereas half a teaspoon would be very spicy. You can use chili flakes instead in the same amount, or one red mild chili pepper., , Ground coriander, : Don\u2019t omit this unless you\u2019re one of those people with that genetic quirk that makes cilantro and ground coriander taste soapy, in that case, you can leave it out., , Garam masala:, If you don\u2019t have this to hand you can either try making your own, garam masala, , substitute it with a high-quality curry powder that you like, or leave it out altogether., , Turmeric, : If you don\u2019t have it, leave it out., , Cooked black beans:, You can use any type of cooked beans in this recipe if you don\u2019t have black beans to hand. I don\u2019t recommend making this recipe in a pressure cooker or instant pot as it will really tamp down the flavor a lot. If you only have dried black beans to hand it\u2019s better to cook them first and then follow the recipe. Or, you can try making my, vegetarian feijoada, ., , Vegetable stock, : If you don\u2019t have stock to hand you can either make some up with a stock cube or bouillon powder. Worst case scenario you can use water, although it won\u2019t be as flavorful., , Coconut cream, : If you don\u2019t have any coconut cream you can chill a can of coconut milk for a few hours and then scoop the cream off the top after opening. For a lower-calorie alternative you can use light coconut milk although be warned it won\u2019t be as creamy. If you\u2019re not vegan, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sour cream or Greek yogurt can all be used instead., , Kasuri methi, : Okay this is optional but, only, because I know that it can sometimes be tricky to find. If you can get it, do. Adding this to your recipe will give it that restaurant-style taste (you can also use it in my, vegan dal tadka recipe, ). You can order it online or pick it up in your local Indian or speciality grocer\u2019s., , Fresh cilantro, : This is optional and can be omitted., , , , How to make it, , chopped and measured, before you begin cooking as things will move pretty fast once you get going. In this section, I like to go through the process of making the recipe in detail for newer or less experienced cooks, but if you\u2019re a pro you can skip this section and scroll down to the recipe card., , First of all, add your plant-based spread to the pan (, image one below, , I use Flora margarine for cooking with, Miyoko and Earth Balance are also great) and turn the heat to medium-high. When all of the spread has melted and the pan is hot (hold your hand an inch over the pan to check the heat) add in the cumin seeds (, image two, )., , When the cumin seeds have lightly browned and/or make popping or crackling sounds (after about two minutes), add the onion and mix well (, image three, ). It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t burn the cumin seeds \u2013 when lightly toasted they impart a lot of flavor, but burnt they can make the dish taste bitter. Cook the onion-cumin mix for around five minutes, stirring often to prevent sticking and burning until the onions are lightly browned., , , , Add the crushed garlic (, image four above, ), reduce the heat to medium, stir and cook one minute more, stirring every 10-15 seconds to prevent the garlic from sticking. I use a garlic crusher on unpeeled cloves of garlic and scrape the skin out after every clove before the next one goes in to stop the crusher from getting jammed. If you don\u2019t have a crusher you can just finely chop the garlic., , Add the seeded finely chopped tomatoes (, image five), , mix well (, image six, ) and fry for another five-seven minutes stirring often until the tomatoes are soft and disintegrating (, image seven below, ). This is why it\u2019s important not to use canned chopped tomatoes, they hold their structure too well and the chunks of tomato don\u2019t add much flavor to sauces, it\u2019s really the juice from the can that adds any flavor, and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going for here., , Add the cayenne pepper, ground coriander, garam masala, and ground turmeric (, image eight, ). Mix well and cook one more minute to toast the spices a little and release more of their flavor., , , , Add the drained rinsed beans and the vegetable stock (, image nine, ). Two cups will give a drier curry as in the photos on this page, two and a half will give more sauce. Add salt to taste (I added a quarter teaspoon but it will depend on how salty your vegetable stock is)., , Increase the heat to high until your black bean curry is at a lively simmer and then reduce to medium to maintain at a simmer for around twelve until thickened to your liking (, image ten above, ) depending on how much sauce you like in your curries.\u00a0Remember that the coconut cream will also loosen the curry more so it\u2019s okay if it looks a little drier than you prefer., , Add the coconut cream, half of the chopped cilantro if using, and the kasuri methi (, image eleven, ). Rub the kasuri methi between your fingers to finely crumble it in. Mix together well and check it\u2019s the consistency you\u2019d like \u2013 if you\u2019d like it more \u201csaucy\u201d you can add up to half a cup of water to loosen it more., , Sprinkle the remaining cilantro over (, image twelve, ) and serve with steamed basmati rice, and garlic naan if you really want a feast!, , Storing it, , This tasty creamy black bean curry can be kept in a tightly sealed container in the fridge for up to five days. The beans will continue to release starch so the sauce may thicken as it sits in the fridge, just loosen by mixing in a little water until it\u2019s at the right consistency, and then either reheat in the microwave on high for two minutes, stirring halfway through or by warming in a saucepan on the stove over medium-low heat and stirring often until it\u2019s heated through., , , , 3 tablespoons plant-based spread, , 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, , 1 large onion, finely chopped, , 4 large garlic cloves, crushed, , 5 medium tomatoes (350 grams), seeded and finely chopped, , \u00bc teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional), , \u00bd tablespoon ground coriander, , \u00bd teaspoon garam masala, , \u00bd teaspoon turmeric, , 3.5 cups cooked black beans (580g, roughly two cans), , 2 - 2.5 cups vegetable stock (depending on how much sauce you want), , Salt to taste, , 4 tablespoons coconut cream, , 3 tablespoons fresh cilantro leaves to serve, finely chopped (optional), , 1.5 teaspoons kasuri methi (optional but recommended), , , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Roberta, , , July 23, 2022 at 12:33 am, , , , Out of this world!

Not to be confused with \u201cmethi\u201d, which is Hindi for fenugreek, and usually refers to the fresh leaves or the seeds. It is a popular herb in Indian cooking., , , What are black beans called in India?, , Although I rarely saw them, black beans are sometimes used in Indian cooking and I believe they\u2019re called black turtle beans., , , How do I cook dried black beans?, , You can simmer the dried beans in three times the amount of water (e.g. one cup of beans to three cups of water), with some aromatics (onion, garlic cloves, halved lemons, bay leaves, bouillon etc.), for around one and a half hours. Soaking overnight will improve how easy they are to digest and help the beans keep their shape better, but isn\u2019t necessary. If you have a pressure cooker, forty minutes on high pressure should give you soft beans. For the Instant Pot, cook thirty minutes at high pressure and leave to naturally release., , , , , I hope you enjoyed this black bean curry, and if you made it please let me know how you got on in the comments below or leave a star rating and review by clicking on the stars in the recipe box., , Ooh, or take a photo and tag me on Instagram (, @the_fiery_vegetarian, ), I love seeing your creations!, , , , , Continue to Content, , , , , , , , Yield: 4 servings, , Creamy Black Bean Curry, , , , , , , , , Print, , , , , This easy creamy black bean curry is dairy-free, egg-free and sumptuous, full of spices and deep rich flavor.

Add cumin seeds., When cumin seeds brown and crackle (after about two minutes), add the onion. Cook for around five minutes until onions are lightly browned., Add garlic and cook for one minute., Add tomatoes, reduce heat to medium, and fry for around five to six minutes, stirring often, until tomatoes are soft and disintegrating., Add the cayenne, ground coriander, garam masala, and turmeric. Mix well and fry for one minute more., Add the drained rinsed beans and vegetable stock. Add salt to taste (I added \u00bc teaspoon but it will depend on how salty your vegetable stock is). Increase heat to high until simmering lively and then reduce to medium to a simmer for twelve minutes until thickened to your liking depending on how much sauce you like in your curries., Add the coconut cream, half the cilantro leaves, and the kasuri methi, rubbing the kasuri methi between your fingers to crumble it in. Mix well and sprinkle remaining cilantro leaves on top to serve., , , , Notes, , , Vegans can use any plant-based spread, vegan butter or dairy-free margarine. If you don't have an issue with dairy or aren't vegan, you can use butter or ghee., Once seeded and finely chopped, you should have about one and a quarter cups of chopped tomatoes., Two cups of vegetable stock will yield a drier gravy while two and a half will yield more sauce. You can adjust the thickness of the gravy by reducing cooking time for more sauce, increasing for a drier curry, adding more water to the finished curry etc., Cilantro leaves are measured, before, chopping. So it should be roughly three tablespoons of the leaves which are then finely chopped., , , , , , Nutrition Information, , Yield, 4, , Serving Size, 1, , Amount Per Serving, , Calories, 333, Total Fat, 5g, Saturated Fat, 3g, Trans Fat, 0g, Unsaturated Fat, 1g, Cholesterol, 0mg, Sodium, 998mg, Carbohydrates, 59g, Fiber, 16g, Sugar, 17g, Protein, 16g, , , , , , , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, , Please leave a comment on the blog or share a photo on, Pinterest, , , , , , , \u00a9 Deirdre Gilna, , , , Cuisine:, Indian, , /, , Category:, Meals in under 30 minutes, , , , , , , , , More Meals in under 30 minutes, Quick Spicy Silken Tofu Recipe, 7 Minute Green Pasta Sauce, Simple Spaghetti Arrabiata, Quick Gochujang Pasta, Reader Interactions, Comments, , , Leave a Reply, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , Recipe Rating, , , , Recipe Rating, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Comment, *, , Name, *, , , Email, *, , , , Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment., , , , , , , , , , , Sarah, , , December 06, 2023 at 1:54 am, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Deirdre Gilna, , , December 06, 2023 at 10:14 am, , , , Yikes, thanks for the heads up.

I multiplied the recipe by three, would multiple it by four next time, and everyone loved it coming back for seconds; served it with basmati rice, garlic naan, fresh corn on the cob, a garden salad & watermelon.  The cayenne was left out and set to the side with chopped hot peppers from the garden for individual choice to add.  We had leftover yogurt & sour cream so we set it aside for a topping also.  I would have cooked it longer next time starting earlier to be more of a. Curry texture.  Thank you.

I used a lovely bunch of lacanato kale that I had in the fridge and cooked it a little longer to make sure it was tender.  I was in a  hurry and didn\u2019t t take out all of the kale ribs and that changed the appearance but I don\u2019t think the taste.  I used some of my dried mint from last summer and added a bit of chicken broth with the water.  Definitely a great option for a quick midweek dinner.  And so beautiful!, , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Tonia | Feasting at Home, , says:, , , , January 23, 2025 at 11:52 am, , , , , Awesome Mert!
