Maintain a medium heat level while frying. Once one side of the bhindi becomes crisp, carefully turn over each piece using a slotted spoon or tongs., , Continue frying until the other side achieves the desired crispiness., , , , 10.\u00a0To achieve a crisp and uniformly fried texture, turn over the bhindi a couple of times during the frying process. This ensures that both sides are evenly cooked and attain the desired level of crispiness., , Use a slotted spoon or tongs to flip the bhindi for consistent results., , , , 11.\u00a0Continue turning the bhindi regularly to ensure even frying. If you notice that the oil has become excessively hot, you can lower the heat to maintain a consistent frying temperature., , This practice helps achieve uniform crispiness and prevents the bhindi from getting overly browned or burnt., , , , 12.\u00a0Fry all the bhindi on medium heat until they turn golden brown and achieve a crisp texture., , , , 13. Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the Kurkuri Bhindi from the pan, allowing any excess oil to drain through the spoon\u2019s slots., , , , 14. Place the fried bhindi on kitchen paper towels arranged on a plate to allow the excess oil to be absorbed., , Proceed to fry the remaining batches of marinated bhindi by adding 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil in the pan. Ensure that the oil is sufficiently hot before introducing the next batch of okra., , , , Serving Suggestions, , Serve the Kurkuri Bhindi directly as is or, if desired, enhance the presentation by garnishing with coriander leaves, julienned ginger, or sliced green chilis., , For added flavor, consider drizzling some lemon juice on top of the Fried Okra. You can also elevate the taste by sprinkling some black salt or chaat masala on the crispy bhindi., , Enjoy the Kurkuri Bhindi either as a standalone snack or paired with roti and a bowl of homemade curd for a delightful and satisfying meal., , , , Expert Tips, , You have to use fresh, tender and bright green ladies\u2019 finger or okra for this recipe. Avoid using the matured ones that are fibrous and stringy., , Completely dry the bhindi before beginning the recipe. The hallmark of this Kurkuri Bhindi recipe is its crispiness. Okra with any amount of moisture/water will not be crisp., , Use hot oil for frying the okra. Not doing so will make the bhindi absorb more oil. Thus, becoming soggy., , You can modify the quantities of the spice powders according to what you prefer. Since I have used a very strong homemade garam masala, I have added 1 teaspoon of it. This can be adjusted according to the freshness of the spice powder., , Shallow frying the okra is a good practice. I don\u2019t suggest deep frying as doing so results in leftovers of besan, spices and okra seeds in the oil. It\u2019s quite a clutter that you wouldn\u2019t want to deal with and eventually have to throw., , You really don\u2019t want a messy oil to strain or discard later. So, use the quantity of oil to fry the okra wisely in order to completely use it., , Bake Kurkuri Bhindi:, Spread marinated okra on a greased tray. Brush some oil on top of okra pieces or else add 1 tablespoon oil in the batter and mix well with the okra. This goes in a preheated oven of 180 degrees C/356 degrees F, and bakes for 18 or 20 minutes or until crispy and golden brown., , The Kurkuri Bhindi recipe can be scaled to make a small or large batch. It is best eaten hot. So, try not to have any leftovers and make the quantity according to your requirements., , FAQs, , How do I know that okra is cooked?, , Keep a check while frying. If the bhindi is soft and crispy too, it means it is cooked., , , Why was my bhindi not kurkuri?, , You must\u2019ve used oil for frying that may not be properly hot. Also, there might be some moisture left on the bhindi pods due to which they were not crisp., , , Can I bake or air fry the bhindi?, , Yes, you can., , , What type of okra should I use in this Kurkuri Bhindi recipe?, , The okra that you use for this recipe has to be fresh, tender and bright green. Not matured, stringy and fibrous., , , , More Bhindi Recipes To Try!, Okra Recipes, Bhindi Masala Recipe (Punjabi Style), Okra Recipes, Bharwa Bhindi Recipe (Punjabi Style), Okra Recipes, Bhindi ki Sabji (Punjabi Style Bhindi Sabzi), Okra Recipes, Bhindi Fry, , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

Wipe them completely dry with a kitchen napkin. Trim off the crown and the base tip., Slice each okra vertically into 4 pieces., If you have small sized okra, then slice into 2 pieces. Take all your sliced okra in a big plate or a big bowl., Now sprinkle all the spice powders one by one on the sliced okra. Season with salt according to taste., With a spoon or spatula, gently mix the spice powders with the okra., Sprinkle the besan on the okra., Again, gently mix the besan with the okra. The besan and the seasonings must evenly coat the okra slices., Marinate the okra in this mixture for 20 to 30 minutes. You could also keep it for an hour., Making Kurkuri Bhindi, In your kadai (wok) or a frying pan, heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil., Add a batch of marinated okra and fry. You can fry in three to four batches depending on the size of kadai. Add more oil if required while frying okra., Fry the okra till golden brown and crisp on a medium heat., Take care and keep on turning the okra so that they get fried evenly. If the oil becomes too hot, you could lower the heat and fry., Keep the fried okra on a crumpled kitchen tissue so that the extra oil gets drained., For the next batch again add 2 to 3 tablespoons oil or as required in the pan. Let the oil become medium hot and then add the marinated bhindi. For each batch add 2 to 3 tablespoons oil or as required while frying., Serve bhindi kurkuri directly as they are or if you want you could garnish okra with coriander leaves, julienned ginger or sliced green chilis., If you like you could also sprinkle some lime or lemon juice on top of the crispy okra.\u00a0you could also sprinkle some black salt (kala namak) or chaat masala on the crispy fried okra., Enjoy the Kurkuri Bhindi as is or pair with roti and a bowl of curd or yogurt., , , Notes, Feel free to adjust the quantities of the ground spice powders according to your taste preferences., , For the best experience, consume this recipe while it\u2019s hot or warm to savor the crispy texture., , While I have only used gram flour, but you can add a few tablespoons of rice flour for a more crispy texture., , It\u2019s advisable to avoid leftovers, so scale the recipe based on your requirements. As it stands, this recipe serves 4., , Opt for bright green, fresh, and tender okra pods for optimal results. Avoid using matured okra that may have become fibrous and stringy., , If needed, the recipe can be easily halved or doubled to accommodate your specific serving size or preferences., , For baking Kurkuri Bhindi \u2013, Spread the marinated okra in a greased tray. Brush some oil on the top of the okra. You can also add 1 tablespoon oil in the marination mixture and mix it very well with the okra. Bake in a preheated oven at 180 degrees C/356 degrees F, for 18 to 20 minutes or until the okra are crisp and golden. It\u2019s essential to monitor the baking process closely, as oven temperatures vary, and the time required for baking may differ., , , , Nutrition Info (Approximate Values), , Nutrition Facts, , Kurkuri Bhindi (Indian Fried Okra), , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 391, , Calories from Fat 297, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 33g, 51%, Saturated Fat 3g, 19%, Polyunsaturated Fat 2g, Monounsaturated Fat 27g, Sodium, 610mg, 27%, Potassium, 532mg, 15%, Carbohydrates, 20g, 7%, Fiber 6g, 25%, Sugar 4g, 4%, Protein, 6g, 12%, , , Vitamin A, 1056IU, 21%, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), 0.3mg, 20%, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), 0.1mg, 6%, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), 2mg, 10%, Vitamin B6, 0.4mg, 20%, Vitamin C, 29mg, 35%, Vitamin E, 14mg, 93%, Vitamin K, 43\u00b5g, 41%, Calcium, 120mg, 12%, Vitamin B9 (Folate), 141\u00b5g, 35%, Iron, 2mg, 11%, Magnesium, 101mg, 25%, Phosphorus, 131mg, 13%, Zinc, 1mg, 7%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , This Kurkuri Bhindi recipe from the blog archives was first published in September 2010.

        "Lehsuni Bhindi": "Ingredients: tamarind, dried mango powder (amchur powder), lime or lemon juice, vinegar, kokum (garcinia indica), curd, buttermilk are great for use, depending on the kind of recipe or dish you are making with okra., , In this recipe of Bhindi Masala, I have used tomatoes and dried mango powder which not only impart a nice tangy taste but also help to get rid of the stickiness and sliminess., , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to make Bhindi Masala, , Prep, and Saut\u00e9 Bhindi, , 1. Rinse 250 grams\u00a0bhindi (okra) well in water using a colander or strainer. Spread them on a tray or plate and let them dry on their own under the fan., , You can even wipe dry each okra pod with a clean kitchen towel., , , , 2. When they are completely dry, chop each bhindi in 1 or 2 inch pieces., , Before chopping, make sure there is not even a single drop of water or any moisture on the okra pods., , , , 3. In a heavy kadai, pan or skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil and add the chopped okra. You can use any neutral-tasting oil. I mostly use sunflower oil or peanut oil., , , , 4. Mix chopped bhindi well with the oil., , , , 5. Now, saut\u00e9 bhindi, stirring often, on low to medium-low heat., , , , 6.\u00a0Saut\u00e9 bhindi until tender and cooked. You should see a few blisters or golden spots on the okra. Remove the saut\u00e9ed okra and keep aside., , Taste the saut\u00e9ed okra. The crunchiness should not be there. Instead, you should taste a nicely softened bhindi. This means that it is well cooked., , Frying or\u00a0saut\u00e9ing okra in oil minimizes the sliminess and stickiness in this recipe., , , , 7. Remove the cooked bhindi in a plate and keep aside. Also chop onions, tomatoes, green chilies and keep aside. Crush ginger and garlic in mortar-pestle to get ginger-garlic paste., , , , Make Onion Tomato Masala, , 8. In the same kadai or pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add 1 medium-sized chopped onion (\u2153 cup chopped onions)., , Note:, , For a richer taste, you can swap oil with ghee (clarified butter)., , , , 9. Mix and begin to saut\u00e9 the onions on low to medium heat., , , , 10. Saut\u00e9 onions, stirring often, until translucent. The onions should be softened., , , , 11. Then, add 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies., , , , 12. Stir and saut\u00e9 on low heat until the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away. This takes about a few seconds., , , , 13. Next, add 2 medium sized chopped\u00a0tomatoes (1 cup chopped tomatoes)., , , , 14. Mix well and begin to saut\u00e9 tomatoes on low to medium-low heat., , If the tomato mixture becomes too dry and starts sticking to the pan, add a few splashes of water \u2013 about 3 to 4 tablespoons water. Mix well and continue to saut\u00e9, stirring often., , , , 15.\u00a0Saut\u00e9 tomatoes till soft and mushy., , , , 16. Now, add\u00a0all of the ground spices listed below:, , \u00bd teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or \u00bd teaspoon sweet paprika or \u00bc teaspoon cayenne pepper, , \u00bd teaspoon turmeric powder\u00a0(ground turmeric), , \u00bd teaspoon garam masala powder, , , , 17. Next, add the following ground spices:, , \u00bd teaspoon fennel powder, optional, , 1 teaspoon coriander powder, , \u00bd teaspoon dried mango powder (amchur powder), , If you do not have dried mango powder, add \u00bd teaspoon dried pomegranate seeds powder (anardana powder)., , You can add lemon juice, but I suggest to squeeze fresh lemon juice on top of the Bhindi Masala while eating it. Adding lemon juice directly to the dish can make it very tangy., , , , 18. Mix the ground spices very well and saut\u00e9 for a\u00a0couple of seconds., , , , Make Bhindi Masala, , 19. Add the saut\u00e9ed bhindi., , , , 20. Season with salt as per taste., , , , 21. Mix very well., , , , 22. Now, add \u00bd teaspoon crushed dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi). If you do not have dried fenugreek leaves, then skip it., , , , 23. Stir the mixture well. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring in between. Check the taste of Bhindi Masala and add more of the ground spice powders and salt, if required., , , , 24. Lastly, add 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves. Mix again. You can also add 1 tablespoon chopped mint leaves, if you do not have coriander leaves., , , , 25. Serve Bhindi Masala hot or warm., , , , Serving Suggestions, , Like all other dry okra recipes, you can savor this Bhindi Masala too with some soft phulka, roti, or chapati. You can also enjoy it with naan, paratha or rumali roti. A side of cucumber raita or veg raita also pairs really well with these combinations., , Make the Bhindi Masala Recipe and also try it as a side dish with some dal-rice or any rice-curry combination. You can also serve it as a side with any North Indian meal., , It can also be packed in the tiffin or lunch box with roti or paratha., , Expert Tips, , Okra or Bhindi:, Buy tender and fresh okra pods when you plan to make any recipe with them. They should have a smooth, shiny look with a nice green color and should not look dry. They should not be dense or fibrous., , Fats:, You can use any neutral-tasting oil to cook this recipe. I usually use peanut oil or sunflower oil. For a richer taste, you can even make this dish in ghee (clarified butter). Optionally, you can also add 1 tablespoon of heavy cream or whipping cream., , Omitting onions and garlic:, If you decide not to add onions and garlic in this recipe, then while saut\u00e9ing tomatoes, add a pinch of asafoetida (hing)., , Spices:, You can add less or more of the ground spices, according to your taste preferences. In place of red chili powder, you can use cayenne powder too. The fennel powder (saunf powder) is optional, you can skip it. If you don\u2019t have dried mango powder (amchur powder), then you can add \u00bd teaspoon dried pomegranate seeds powder (anardana powder)., , Dried fenugreek leaves:, If you do not have dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi), then simply skip them. But it gives a good aroma and restaurant like taste., , Lemon or lime juice:, You can add lemon juice, but I suggest to squeeze fresh lemon juice on top of the dish while eating it. Adding lemon juice directly to the dish can make it very tangy., , Herbs:, In place of chopped coriander leaves, you can also add 1 tablespoon of chopped mint leaves., , Variation:, For a hearty, filling dish, you can opt to add roasted, saut\u00e9ed or pan-fried potato cubes., , Scaling:, My recipe can be easily scaled \u2013 halved, doubled or tripled., , More Bhindi Recipes To Try!, Okra Recipes, Bhindi ki Sabji (Punjabi Style Bhindi Sabzi), Okra Recipes, Kurkuri Bhindi (Indian Fried Okra), Okra Recipes, Bhindi Do Pyaza Recipe (Punjabi Style), Okra Recipes, Bharwa Bhindi Recipe (Punjabi Style), , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

When you fry or saut\u00e9 okra before you make a gravy or masala, it will not only make your gravy or sauce taste good but also remove the stickiness from okra. In this Bhindi Masala Recipe, I have saut\u00e9ed okra first., , Fats:, The addition of extra oil also minimizes stickiness. 3 tablespoons of oil which is added in this Bhindi Masala Recipe is perfect. You can even add 4 tablespoons of oil. However, do not reduce the oil to 2 tablespoons., , , Preparation, Rinse the bhindi (okra) well in water for a couple of times., Dry them on a large plate on their own or wipe with a kitchen towel. Make sure there is no moisture or water on the okra pods., Remove the base and stalk while chopping them.\u00a0Chop into 1 or 1.5 inch pieces., Also chop onions and tomatoes. Keep aside., Make a paste of ginger and garlic in mortar-pestle and keep aside., Saut\u00e9ing bhindi, Heat 2 tbsp oil in a kadai (wok) or pan., Add the chopped bhindi and saut\u00e9 stirring often till they are completely cooked. You will have to keep an eye on them and stir in between many times., Taste the saut\u00e9ed okra and if the crunchiness is not there and the bhindi have become soft, it means they are cooked. Keep the saut\u00e9ed bhindi aside., Saut\u00e9ing onions, tomatoes, spices, All the oil will be used up. So add 1 tablespoon oil to the same pan., Add chopped onions and saut\u00e9 stirring often on low to medium heat till they become translucent and are softened., Add the ginger-garlic paste and saut\u00e9 on low heat for a few seconds or till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears., Add the chopped tomatoes and saute stirring often till the tomatoes become soft and mushy., If the tomato mixture becomes too dry and starts sticking to the pan, then add about \u00bc cup water. Mix well and continue to cook., All the above cooking is done in a open pan and you don\u2019t need to cover the pan with the lid., Add all the dry ground spice powders one by one., Mix well and saute for a few seconds on low heat., Making bhindi masala, Add the saut\u00e9ed bhindi, crushed kasuri methi, salt and mix so that the onion-tomato masala coats the okra well., Cook for about 2 minutes. Stir in between., Then turn off the heat and add chopped coriander leaves. Mix again., Serve Bhindi Masala hot or warm garnished with a few coriander leaves and accompanied with chapati, roti or naan., It can also be packed for lunch box. It also makes for a nice side dish with any North Indian meal., , Video, , , , , Notes, Okra:, Buy tender and fresh okra pods. They should have a smooth, shiny look with a nice green color. They should not be dry, dense or fibrous., , Scaling:, You can easily halve or double the recipe., , Omitting onions and garlic:, If you decide not to add onions and garlic, then when saut\u00e9ing tomatoes, add a pinch of asafoetida (hing)., , Spicing and seasonings:, You can add less or more of the ground spices according to your taste preferences., , Dried fenugreek leaves:, Skip dried fenugreek leaves if you do not have them., , Fats:, You can make this recipe in any neutral flavored oil.

        "Bhindi Fry": "Ingredients: , fresh coconut, sambar powder or other spice powders., , This bhindi fry is flavored with roasted & crushed peanuts, coconut & sesame seeds which perk up the nutrition of dish. It turns out very delicious and aromatic., , I make bhindi often at home since my kids\u2019 love it in any form. Most of the times I end up making stir fry to serve with roti, rice, , Sambar, or, Rasam, . I often make, Andhra style bendakaya vepudu, with coconut and roasted peanuts which is a favorite at home., , Sometimes we also serve it with curd rice. I make bhindi fry each time with different seasonings as my kids\u2019 don\u2019t like repeating the same. The recipe I have shared here is one of the delicious ways to prepare bhindi fry., , If you are a weight watcher skip peanuts and use coconut or sesame. You can also skip all of the 3 and just sprinkle some garam masala., , You may also like, Sauteed Okra, Aloo Bhindi, Bhindi do pyaza, Easy bhindi masala, Bhindi ki sabzi, Vendakkai poriyal, , , , Pro Tips, , , Rinse and dry bhindi well with a kitchen tissue or cloth before chopping. This prevents them turning slimy while chopping and stir frying., , If using frozen okra for stir frying, then spread them on kitchen tissues for a while so the excess moisture is reduced or absorbed by the tissues. To some extent this helps in reducing the slime while cooking., , You can easily skip my spice powder mentioned in the recipe below and use any other spice powders like peanut podi, flax seed podi, idli podi or chutney podi., , , Can I Air fry or Bake?, , Yes. You can also bake or air fry chopped bhindi for the first few minutes so they cook faster in the pan. Most of the slime will just dry up in the oven/air fryer., , \u25a2, 500 grams (1.1 lb), , okra, , (bhindi, ladies finger), \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , oil, , or as needed, \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , cumin seeds, , (jeera), \u25a2, 1, , green chili, , slit (skip if making for kids), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , salt, , (adjust to taste), \u25a2, \u215b, , teaspoon, , turmeric, \u25a2, \u00be to 1, , teaspoon, , red chili powder, , (for kids \u2013  \u00bc to \u00bd tsp), To roast or use \u00be tsp garam masala, \u25a2, 1\u00bd, , tablespoons, , peanuts, , (or 2 tbsps almond meal), \u25a2, 1\u00bd, , tablespoons, , desiccated coconut, , (optional) (copra tastes best), \u25a2, 1, , tablespoons, , white sesame seeds, , (optional), \u25a2, 1 to 2, , garlic, , cloves, \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , cumin seeds, , (jeera),  Instructions: follow the recipe as is and add them to the tempering., , In the air fryer I keep them for 4 mins at 160 C (320 F). Keeping them for too long will make them dry & lifeless. I am sharing what works for me. You may need to adjust the timing as it depends on your air fryer. I drizzle little oil before air frying., , To bake them in oven, toss them in little oil and spread them on a greased foil. Bake at 180 C (350 F) for 5 to 6 mins. Avoid baking them for too long they become too dry., , , Photo Guide, , How To Make Bhindi Fry (Stepwise Photos), , Prepare okra, , 1. Rinse bhindi under running water. Drain them to a colander and wipe dry with a kitchen cloth or tissue. Remember any moisture will make our Bhindi slimy. For this recipe I have used 500 grams of okra., , , , 2. Chop them to half inch pieces and set aside. For comfort while chopping use kitchen tissue to wipe off the slime from the knife., , Make Okra Stir Fry, , 3. Heat oil in a pan. Once the oil is hot, reduce the flame and add \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon cumin seeds. I have used about 2.5 tbsps here since I have not used a non stick pan. You can reduce it to 1.5 tbsp if using a non stick pan., , , , 4. When the jeera begins to splutter add chopped bhindi and stir fry on a medium heat., , 5. Keep stirring at regular intervals. Over doing it will make the bhindi more slimy so do it as needed only. Bhindi will begin to turn slimy after a minute. To reduce the slime I usually sprinkle some lemon juice but I have not done it this time. As we fry them, the slim will reduce. Mean while let us make the nut and spice powder., , , , Make Spiced Nut Powder, , 6. You can skip the peanuts from the recipe and use only coconut or sesame seeds. You can also just use garam masala and skip all of these three. Sometimes I also sprinkle only almond meal, garlic powder, cumin powder and desiccated coconut. The choice is yours., , 7. While the bhindi is getting fried, add 1\u00bd\u00a0tablespoons peanuts and 1 to 2 cloves of garlic to a small pan. Roast them on a medium flame until peanuts turn golden and aromatic. Meanwhile keep an eye on the bhindi and keep stirring., , , , 8. Turn off the heat and add 1\u00bd\u00a0tablespoons dried coconut and 1\u00a0tablespoon white sesame seeds. I have also used  \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds here. Fry lightly for a minute or so until the sesame seeds begin to splutter or until they smell good., , , , 9. Cool them completely and make a coarse powder., , , , 10. When the bhindi is done, you will find that they are no more slimy. At this stage add 1/3 teaspoon salt and \u215b\u00a0teaspoon turmeric. Mix well., , , , 11. Pour 1 teaspoon oil to the center of the pan. Add \u00be to 1 teaspoon red chili powder to it. If you have kids at home reduce to \u00bc to \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon. Let the chilli powder fry in oil for about 10 seconds., , , , 12. Then mix it well with the bhindi. Fry for another 3 to 4 mins if desired. I do not prefer to over cook bhindi so I did not fry further., , 13. Add the peanut powder., , , , 14. Mix it well with the bhindi. It doesn\u2019t need to be cooked further. Taste test bhindi fry and adjust salt accordingly., , , , Enjoy bhindi fry with rice or roti., , , , , Related Recipes, , Aloo Bhindi Recip..., , , Bhindi Masala Rec..., , , Bhindi Ki Sabji |..., , , Bhindi Do Pyaza, , , Sauteed Okra Reci..., , , Kakarakaya fry | ..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Bhindi Fry | Okra Stir Fry, , , 4.99, from, 74, votes, , , , Bhindi fry is Indian style okra stir fry made with fresh okra, spices, nuts, seeds and herbs.
