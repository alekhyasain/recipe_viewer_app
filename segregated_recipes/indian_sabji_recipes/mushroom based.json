Both mushroom and peppers became quite soggy since then., , Kindly suggest if anything to be taken care to make it like a dry sabji ,the way it looks in your picture above. thanks, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Poonam, , , , July 2, 2020 4:25 am, , , , , , Hello Poonam, Some kind of mushrooms just let out lots of water if covered while cooking. Next time try to saute them without covering. Once done do not leave the pan covered on the stove. Remove it from the heat and avoid covering it until it cools down. I also don\u2019t cook cold veggies from the fridge as they let out moisture. Is that the reason? not sure though!

Please try again., , , , , , , , , Instructions: \u25a2, To make mushroom pepper fry, first make the spice powder. Add fennel seeds and black pepper to a grinder jar and powder them., \u25a2, Pour oil to a hot pan. Add cumin seeds and chopped garlic. Saute until the garlic smells good for a minute or so., \u25a2, Add tomatoes, salt and turmeric. Cook until the tomatoes break down and become mushy and soft., \u25a2, Next add capsicum, chilies and onions. Saute on a high flame until the raw smell of onions is gone., How to Make Mushroom Pepper Fry, \u25a2, Add mushrooms & fry on a high heat for 3 mins. If you see the mushrooms letting out moisture, stir fry on the highest heat until the mushrooms become slightly tender., \u25a2, Then add crushed pepper, fennel seeds and curry leaves. Fry for 2 to 3 mins until you begin to smell the spices good., \u25a2, Turn off when the mushrooms are done to your liking. Do not overcook as they become mushy. Remove mushroom pepper fry to a wide serving bowl and leave uncovered for a while to avoid building up moisture., \u25a2, Serve mushroom pepper fry with rice or roti. or stuff it to make wraps and sandwiches., , , Notes, , Sometimes I use bottled ground black pepper and fennel powder. It works well but fresh ground spices are much more flavorful., , I make this a lot of times without tomato and onions as well. The dish turns out great even without them.

        "Kadai Mushroom": "Ingredients: tomatoes and herbs also are used., , As the name suggests, the dish is cooked in a basic Indian wok known as Kadai. There are a lot of North Indian dishes made in a kadai. So they are named after it, like, Kadai Paneer, , kadai chicken etc. A special spice blend known as kadai masala is used to flavor up these kadai dishes., , Kadai masala enhances the aroma of any dish, giving it a completely different flavor profile. A kadai dish can be made with vegetables, paneer or even with legumes like chana. The basic idea is to cook them with this super flavorful spice blend in a Indian wok. However if you do not have a kadai simply make the dish in any pan., , So kadai masala is the star of this kadai mushroom recipe that lends a very unique flavor & taste. We love this at home so much that I keep making it quite often., , My Recipe, , In this post, I have shared 2 recipes. One to make kadai mushroom gravy and the other to make the semi-dry version. The gravy version goes well with both the rice and flatbreads, while the dry version goes well with soft rotis or to use it in wraps and sandwiches., , Both these keep good in the office and school lunch boxes. To make rolls, wraps and sandwiches for my kids, I usually smear some greek yogurt or hung curd to bring down the heat. But the yogurt option won\u2019t go well in the lunch boxes as it makes the wraps and sandwiches soggy., , For more Mushroom Recipes, you can check, Tandoori mushroom tikka, Mushroom masala, Hot garlic mushrooms, Mushroom pepper fry, , , , Photo Guide, , How to make Kadai Mushroom Gravy (Stepwise Photos), , Preparation, , 1.

After making the kadai masala powder, I transferred it to a small bowl. And then used the same jar here., , , , 7. Make a smooth paste of the onions and tomatoes without adding water. Set this aside., , , , 8. Add another tbsp of oil to the pan. Wash and slice mushrooms just before cooking them. Fry them well for 2 to 3 mins., , , , 9.

Add sliced mushrooms, diced onions, bell pepper, garam masala & kasuri methi. Mix and fry stirring often for 3 to 4 mins until the raw smell of the onions reduce., , , , 7. After that I prefer to cover and cook on a low heat until mushrooms turn tender so they absorb the flavors & release some moisture. If the veggies become too dry in the pan, sprinkle some water. I did not add any. Taste test and adjust the salt., , , , Garnish kadai mushroom with chopped coriander and grated ginger., , , , Notes:, For a slightly creamy consistency of the gravy, blend tomatoes with 10 cashews until smooth and use. After sauteing the mushroom, pour little water and cook until the gravy turns thick and the mushrooms are done., , Pro tips, , , Usually kadai masala is made with coriander powder, fennel seeds, red chilies & some garam masala. I have given the recipe to make the kadai masala as well in the same post. If you do not have the whole spices and chilies just use any ready made kadai masala., , I have used button mushrooms which are best for this curry. Feel free to use any other kind., , You can also make this mushroom recipe with other mixed veggies like potatoes, peas & bell peppers. Just get creative and add what ever veggies you like with mushrooms. You can also add some paneer., , I have added few cashews to make the gravy slightly rich.

I used frozen but defrosted and removed excess water., It seemed to take over the flavour and made it very 'green' and herby. More thai curry like., Could I have used too much?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Michelle Alston, , , August 01, 2021 at 11:56 am, , , , Hi Kat, it does sound like you may have used too much spinach. You didn't say how much you added but the spinach shouldn't make this curry green or change the flavour of it too much. The other thing is that I make this with fresh baby (young) spinach, which works best. Frozen spinach will be the older type of spinach which is a lot stronger in flavour so you would need to use a lot less than the fresh baby spinach, this could possibly be where you went wrong.

Thank you, Michelle. I've added this to my reliable repeat recipes. I used the given recipe as a base and then modified the first time I made it. Here is how I changed it:, , Eliminated: yellow mustard seeds, whole red chili pepper, Added: 1 tsp black mustard seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, 8 curry leaves, 1/2 -2/3 tsp red chili powder, Changed: 2 fresh tomatoes and half can of full fat coconut milk (instead of 1 can crushed tomatoes and 1 whole can coconut milk), 1. Once oil is hot add 1 tsp mustard seeds. Once they crackle/splutter, 2. Add 1/2 tsp cumin seeds. Let the seeds get a little brown, 3. Add the finely chopped onion. Stir and cook until translucent, 4. Add the ginger and garlic. Stir until raw ginger garlic smell has disappeared (2 min), 5. Add the curry leaves (I used fresh ones), sautee x 1 min, 6. Add the ground spices - 1/2 tsp turmeric (I reduced it from 1 tsp), 1/2-1 tsp salt (to taste), 1/2 tsp fenugreek powder, 1/2 -2/3 tsp red chili powder, 1.5 tsp curry powder. Cook for about 1 min., 7.  Add the mushrooms (I only had a large container of sliced portabella, so used this). Stir nicely. These release water, so I covered the pan and allowed these to cook and simmer in the spices and released water for several minutes (2-3 min)., 8. While this was sauteeing with a lid on, I used a high powered blender to puree my two roughly chopped tomatoes and 1/2 can of coconut milk. I added about 1/4 c of cooked chickpeas to create a slight thickness to this sauce., 9. I added the tomato-coconut milk-chickpea sauce to the mushroom, onion, and spice pan and mixed well.  I covered this and simmered this for 5 min so the tomatoes could cook and the acid and all the spices could come together., 10.  Next, I added a can of cooked chickpeas. I let this simmer, covered, for another 5 min, 11. Finally, I added fresh spinach (estimated based on how much I wanted) and turned off the gas after a min and kept this covered., By the time the rest of dinner was done, this was a nice thick mushroom curry., Many thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Michelle Alston, , , January 25, 2021 at 10:33 am, , , , Hi Neetu, I'm so glad you liked it and have added it to your reliable repeat recipes!

Really easy, but not as good as everyone  else seems to think. Bit too much ginger for good balance (my taste?) and far too thin. More like soup than sauce, despite adding tomato puree to try and thicken. Suggest that half amount of ginger and coconut milk would  be better.  Maybe try this next time. If I try it again, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Michelle Alston, , , January 17, 2021 at 1:05 pm, , , , Hi Richard, I'm so sorry this wasn't to your liking. I have made this many times and have never felt that the ginger was too much. I have never felt that this curry was soup-like, but if you prefer a thicker sauce then I would recommend adding a mixture of cornstarch and water, 1 teaspoon of cornstarch and 3 or 4 tablespoons of water mixed together then added in towards the end of cooking, this would thicken it better than adding the tomato puree.

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: Heat the oil in a large\u00a0saut\u00e9 pan. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes over a medium heat. The onions should be soft and golden., Add the garlic, ginger and chilli and cook for another 2 minutes. Stir in the spices and cook for 1 minute until to can smell them. Add a splash of water if it gets too dry., Now add the mushrooms and a splash of water stir until the mushrooms are covered in the spices. Season with the salt and pepper., Pour in the can of tomatoes and add the chickpeas, stir and leave to simmer for 5 minutes. Then add the coconut milk, stir and leave to simmer gently for another 5 minutes., Add the spinach. As soon as the spinach has wilted the curry is ready. Serve immediately with basmati rice (white or brown), lime wedges and some coriander leaves., , Notes, , Mushrooms -, I use a mixture of chestnut/brown mushrooms and Portobello mushrooms for this curry. Chestnut mushrooms have more flavour than white mushrooms and portobello mushrooms are nice and meaty when cooked., , Coconut Milk -, I use full-fat coconut milk for this recipe, if you are avoiding coconut products then some readers have had success using almond milk and then thickening the sauce with a cornstarch/cornflour slurry., , Heat -, This curry is deliberately mild to suit children's taste buds. If you want a spicier curry then increase the curry powder to two heaped teaspoons. You could add more chilli too if you want., , Nutritional Information -, is approximate it is calculated using an online nutrition tool and does not include rice., , Recipe Inspiration -, This recipe was roughly adapted from Jaime Oliver's, Curry, , , Nutrition, Calories:, 411, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 32.1, g, |, Protein:, 11.6, g, |, Fat:, 29, g, |, Saturated Fat:, 21.8, g, |, Sodium:, 457, mg, |, Potassium:, 947, mg, |, Fiber:, 7.8, g, |, Sugar:, 6.7, g, |, Calcium:, 78, mg, |, Iron:, 7, mg, , , , , Did you Make this Recipe?

I wanted something to use the abundance of mushrooms in my fridge. As I also had a lot of sweet potatoes I added 2 of those in place of chickpeas. First I cubed them and roasted in my airfryer! We almost ate the whole lot with the hubby between the both of us. I did not have yellow mustard seed so used black and no ground fenugreek so used dried fenugreek leaves. Also added a teaspoon of Kashmiri chilli powder as I love it. What a dish! Might make one tomorrow as well as I am already craving it. One question though, do you mean dries fenugreek seeds or leaves?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Michelle Alston, , , February 07, 2022 at 10:41 am, , , , Hi Sylvia, thank you so much for your lovely comment, I'm so glad that you loved it!

This curry definitely takes 30 minutes to cook.
