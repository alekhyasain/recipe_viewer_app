        "Palak Chole": "Ingredients: , , , 8. Blend to a coarse or smooth paste, according to your preference. I prefer a smooth paste for the chana saag., , , , Make the chana palak curry, , 9. While the saag cools, prepare the rest of the dish. Chop the tomatoes. I deseed the tomatoes before chopping. Heat 1\u00bd tablespoons of oil in the same pan. Reduce the heat to medium and add 1 cup (2 medium) chopped tomatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt, or as per your taste., , , , 10. Saut\u00e9 the tomatoes for 4-5 minutes, until they turn mushy and soft. Stir frequently to ensure the food doesn\u2019t burn. Now add \u00be teaspoon garam masala., , , , 11. Add cooked chana. Add 1\u00bd cups of water (chana water and extra liquid)., , , , 12. Cover pan with lid and let the chana simmer for 4 to 5 minutes. This allows the spice flavors to mix with the chickpeas. Reduce heat to low and add the blended saag mixture., , , , 13. Stir well to combine and cook the chana saag for 1 -2 minutes or until the curry starts to bubble. Taste and adjust seasonings. Overcooking at this stage will darken the saag. Remove from heat and pour into a large serving bowl., , , , Make the tempering (optional), , 14. Heat a small saucepan and melt 1 tablespoon of ghee or butter on low heat. Add 2 dried red chilies and 1 to 2 chopped garlic (1 tablespoon). Pan fry on low heat for 1 minute or until the garlic turns light golden brown. Add \u00bd teaspoon of hing (asafetida) and turn off the flame. Do not overcook garlic as it tastes bitter., , , , 15. Drizzle this tempering over the chana saag and serve it with cooked rice, roti, paratha or, butter naan, . Drizzle some lemon juice., , , , Expert Tips, , , Use green chilies with caution. Saute 2, blend one & set aside another. Use the other one only if required later. You may just chop and add it later., , For add \u00bd cup of methi or fenugreek leaves. You\u2019ll be sauteing the methi in oil and before cooking tomatoes. This helps remove the slightly astringent flavor of fenugreek leaves., , If you don\u2019t have picky eaters at home, you can simply skip saut\u00e9ing and pureeing onions with spinach. Instead saute the chopped onions before the tomatoes. This also adds some texture to your saag., , Don\u2019t have the time to soak and cook chickpeas? Use 3 cups of canned chickpeas in a pinch. If you\u2019re adding the liquid from the can, go easy on the salt and reduce the amount of water mentioned in my recipe., , For extra saag (gravy) in the recipe, reduce the chana to 3/4 cup or 2 cups cooked., , Use the tangier, chole, or chana masala instead of garam masala., , Make it vegan by subbing the ghee and butter in the tempering with oil., , , , Related Recipes, , Saag Paneer, , , Palak Recipes | S..., , , Chickpea Curry Re..., , , Spinach Curry Rec..., , , Hara Bhara Kabab ..., , , Black Eyed Peas C..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Chana Saag Recipe (Chana Palak), , , 5, from, 50, votes, , , , Chana saag also known as chana palak is a delicious and healthy Indian dish made with various leafy greens, chickpeas and spices.

Make a fine or coarse paste as per your liking. We prefer smooth paste., How to make Chana Saag, \u25a2, While the greens cool, heat another tbsp oil in the same pan. Add tomatoes and salt. Saute and cook until soft and mushy., \u25a2, Add garam masala, cooked chana and 1\u00bd cups liquid (chana cooked water plus more water)., \u25a2, Cover and simmer chana for 5 minutes. Then reduce the heat and transfer the saag paste to the pan., \u25a2, Stir well and cook just for a minute or 2 until chana saag begins to bubble., \u25a2, Taste test and adjust salt and more garam masala if required. Turn off the heat and transfer to a serving bowl., Tempering (optional, but recommended), \u25a2, On a low heat, melt 1 tbsp butter or ghee in a small pan. Add dried red chilies and chopped garlic. Fry on a low heat until garlic turns slightly golden but not brown. Add hing and turn off., \u25a2, Quickly pour the tempering over the chana saag., , , Notes,  Instructions: Preparation, \u25a2, Rinse and soak chana overnight. Later drain them and rinse well. Pressure cook them with 1 cup water for 3 to 4 whistles until soft and tender. To cook in instant pot, pressure cook for 16 to 18 minutes and let the pressure release naturally., \u25a2, Pour 1\u00bd tablespoon oil to a pan and heat it. Saute ginger, garlic and green chilies for a minute., \u25a2, Add onions and saute until golden and fully cooked. Then stir in spinach and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, just until wilted. Transfer to a plate and cool this completely., \u25a2, , Do not increase the quantity of coriander leaves in the recipe. Use only tender stalks and avoid mature ones as they tend to leave a soapy flavor., , If you are using spinach it is just fine to cook for a shorter period of time as mentioned in the recipe. But all leafy greens are not the same. They need longer cooking else they can upset the stomach. So if using other greens cook them longer., , You can use half cup methi leaves.

My Great Grandma apparently used to make Nettle Soup in Spring. It is a free food that is extremely nutritious yet not many people eat it these days. I however love it and this is a perfect recipe to do something different with it. Perhaps childhood memories of being stung by this plant have put people off but it was a lifesaver for many in years gone by. I always use gloves, when harvesting and washing but a quick blanch melts the offending needle like hairs that inject histamine and other chemicals into the unfortunate person that brushes past it., That said, be brave. It is a delicious vegetable in its own right., I\u2019m looking forward to trying this., Paul \ud83d\ude42, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Paul:-), , , , January 20, 2025 2:20 am, , , , , , Hi Paul,, That\u2019s lovely to know about stinging nettle and thanks for sharing that.

Any kind of dried red chilies will work because they are used only to impart pungent flavors and not for heat. I use very mild chilies for low heat preference. We feel this dish tastes best when the heat levels are kept low to moderate. Hope this helps.

Then I added the Chana dal and let it simmer together for a bit. Served with millet boiled with finely chopped cauliflower.

        "Chole Masala": "Ingredients: How to make Chana Masala (Stepwise Photos), Expert Tips, Faqs, Recipe Card, , , About My Authentic Recipe, , To make this recipe, , , Use yellow or red onions (avoid large purple onions). Fresh tomatoes are best, if not use canned whole peeled tomatoes, , Chickpeas:, Use dried chickpeas or canned. It is essential to use fresh stock of dried chickpeas because old legumes that have been sitting in the shelves take longer to cook (may take forever). Avoid buying stocks that are labelled older than 12 months., , Garam masala and red chili powder:, I use this homemade garam masala but you can use any aromatic store bought version. I use Kashmiri or Byadgi chili powder for low heat levels. You can also use a combination of paprika and cayenne., , Other ground spices, like ground coriander, ground cumin and turmeric help to cut down the acidity from tomatoes & tone down the strength of garam masala. Though they add a little flavor they work more to round-out the flavors., , Kasuri Methi:, Dried fenugreek leaves also known as kasuri methi are classic, an herb not to miss in any North Indian dishes. There is no substitute for this. These leaves are super fragrant and impart an earthy, hay-like flavor, with very mild bitter tones. They are also used in many Indian dishes like dal, butter chicken and chicken tikka., , Amchur:, Dried green mango powder is known as Amchur. It imparts slightly sweet, fruity & tangy flavors (that is different from tomatoes). There is no substitute for this ingredient but you can use lemon juice (not lime) at the time of serving., , Whole Spices:, We love whole spices like Indian bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms for fresh and better flavors. Most store bought garam masala are oxidized and do not have great flavors. So using whole spices will compensate for the lost flavors., , , Here are some of the popular recipes made with legumes, Red Lentil Curry, Aloo Chana Kurma, Chickpea Curry, Rajma Masala, Dal Makhani, Easy Dal Tadka, Dal Fry, , , Photo Guide, , How to make Chana Masala (Stepwise Photos), , If you are using canned chickpeas (use 2- 15 oz cans that equals to 3 cups), jump to step 4., , Prepare the Chickpeas, , 1. Add 1 cup dried chickpeas to a large bowl and rinse them well a few times. Pour 3 \u00bd to 4 cups fresh water and soak them overnight or for at least 8 hours. Later drain the water & rinse them well., , , , 2. Pressure cooker: Pour 1 \u00bd cups fresh water to the chana and pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles on a medium heat. If using Instant pot, cook them for 18 minutes on a high pressure. Once the pressure drops naturally, open the lid., , Regular pot: Cook the soaked chickpeas with 3 cups water in a heavy bottom pot. Please check the faq section for more details., , , , 3., Test the texture, Test if they are soft cooked, tender and hold shape (not mushy). When you squeeze a chickpea it should get mashed completely. If it is still firm, it is undercooked and you need to cook it longer., , , , Make Onion Tomato Masala, , 4. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a pot and add the whole spices (optional). You will need 1 bay leaf, 1 inch cinnamon, 2 cloves and 2 green cardamoms. If you do not have them simply omit., , , , 5. When they begin to sizzle add 1\u00bd cups fine chopped onions (2 large/medium) and saute until golden, for about 8 to 9 mins. If you want you may add a slit green chili for heat but I do not use it., , , , 6. Add 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste and saute for a minute, making sure not to burn it., , , , 7. Add 1\u00bd cup chopped tomatoes (or tomato puree or whole peeled tomatoes) and \u00be teaspoon salt. Continue to cook until the tomatoes break down and turn mushy, for 6 to 7 mins. You may cover and cook to quicken the process., , , , 8. Next add all the ground spices, , , 1 to 1\u00bd teaspoons Kashmiri Red chilli powder (I use 1\u00bd), , \u00bc teaspoon turmeric, , 1 teaspoon garam masala, , 2 teaspoons coriander powder, , \u00bd teaspoon cumin powder, , , , , 9. Saute on a medium flame until the masala smells aromatic. This takes about 3 to 4 minutes., , , , 10. This step is optional and you may skip if you want your gravy to be chunky. You have the option to skip this step or blend the onion tomato masala to a coarse or smooth puree depending on how you want your chana masala gravy., , If you prefer to blend it, discard the bay leaf and cinnamon first. Cool the mixture and blend to a puree. Optionally I also prefer to add 2 tablespoons of cooked chana to the blender. Later add the puree back to the same pan., , , , Make the Chickpea Masala, , 11. Add the chana along with the stock in which you cooked it. You will be left with 1\u00bc cup stock which you will add it. Pour more water as needed to make a gravy. I use about \u00be to 1 cup more water. If you don\u2019t puree the onion tomato masala you will require lesser., , Canned chickpeas: Drain the liquid in the can, rinse the chana well with fresh water and use here. Pour 2 cups water., , , , 12. Mix everything well and taste test. Add more salt if required., , , , 13. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes, until the gravy turns thick., , , , 14. Add \u00bd teaspoon amchur powder (optional) and 1 teaspoon kasuri methi. Crush it in your palms first and then sprinkle., , , , 15. This is the right consistency \u2013 thick. Chana masala will thicken slightly further upon cooling., , , , 16. At this stage I always feel the need to add more salt as the chickpeas absorb some amount of it from the gravy. So taste test add more salt and squeeze some lemon juice if you have not used amchur., , , , Serve Chana Masala with fluffy, Basmati Rice, , one pot, Jeera rice, , No yeast fast, Naan, , Roti, , Chapati, or, Paratha, . This, Cucumber Raita, , , Pepper Mushrooms, and, Beans Poriyal, make some great sides., , , , Expert Tips, , If you are using old chickpeas that have been sitting in the shelves for long. Add a pinch of baking soda while you cook the chickpeas. This helps to cook them faster. Discard half of the stock and use only the rest while you cook the dish. Using all of the stock can leave an aftertaste., , Faqs, , How to cook dried chickpea without soaking?, , Give them an instant soak by pouring 6 cups of boiling water to 1 cup of chickpeas. Cover and keep for an hour. Later pressure cook them as instructed in the recipe. But the texture & flavor of the chickpeas is not the same. Soaked legumes are lighter in texture and cook up well easily. They are easier to digest when soaked & prevents tummy upsets., , , How to cook dried chickpeas in a pot?, , Cooking chickpeas in a pot takes about 45 to 60 minutes. Soak the dried chickpeas overnight with 1/3 teaspoon baking soda. The next morning drain the water and rinse them well. Bring 3 cups of water to a rolling boil and a cook until tender, discarding any froth that comes on top., , , How to use canned chickpeas to make chana masala?, , chickpeas won\u2019t cook further after adding it to the masala. So make sure your canned chickpeas are soft and tender enough yet hold shape. Test by squeezing a chickpea in between your thumb and index finger, it should mash easily. Drain the liquid and rinse them well. If they are still hard, add them to a pot and cook them with 1 cup water until tender.

It takes much longer for the chana to cook and the gravy may burn at the bottom. You can saute the onion tomato masala in the pressure cooker, remove to a bowl/blender and pressure cook the chickpeas in the same cooker. While they cook, cool down and puree the masala. Once the pressure drops, add the puree and simmer for 10 mins.

I just tried it and it turned out well but I have a question: I only have powdered spices. Should I warm all the spices in the oil before the onions or add them in the order of your recipe?

So it\u2019s nothing but chickpeas simmered in a spicy onion tomato masala. This is one of the world\u2019s most popular vegetarian curries & is a staple in the Indian homes & restaurants., , Though the dish originated in Punjab region of India, it is made in numerous ways across the Indian sub-continent. So Chana masala is a common term that refers to chickpeas cooked with plenty of spices. You will find anywhere from extremely spicy to mild toned down versions. The recipe shared here will yield you something in between the both but you can easily up or cut down the spices further to suit your taste., , Often people confuse Chana Masala with, Chole Masala, but both are different. A special blend of spices and the preparation (boiling) of chickpeas is unique to the Punjabi chole, which makes it taste very different from a chickpea masala., , Table of contents, What is Chana Masala?, About My Authentic Recipe, in which we soak the dried chickpeas overnight and cook until tender. It is a one pan-dish and takes only 30 to 35 mins, if you have canned or cooked chickpeas ready., , The recipe starts with making the masala/ curry. We saute the onions, ginger, garlic and cook with tomatoes and spices. Lastly chickpeas are simmered in this masala until tender and soak up the flavors. The finished dish is healthy, protein-packed and delicious with a burst of flavors., , I like to start my chana masala with dried chickpeas because that\u2019s how we make the dish traditionally. Like most Indian homes, I pressure cook them to save time. If you do not have a pressure cooker and want to make the recipe with dried chickpeas, refer my Faq section to cook them in pot., , If you chose to go with canned chickpeas, make sure you use chickpeas that are perfectly tender, still hold shape and not mushy. Undercooked or mushy chickpeas are not good to make this dish., , Prepare Chickpeas (Skip this section to use canned chickpeas), \u25a2, Rinse dried chickpeas at least thrice. Soak them in 3 \u00bd to 4 cups of water overnight or for at least 8 hours., \u25a2, Drain the water and rinse them well. Pour water and pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles on a stovetop cooker. You may also cook in an instant pot for 18 minutes on a high pressure. Let the pressure drop naturally., \u25a2, Make sure your chickpeas are soft and tender. Squeeze a chickpea to test, it should get mashed fully. If not cook them for a little longer., How to make Chickpea Masala, \u25a2, Heat a large pot and pour oil. When the oil turns slightly hot, add the whole spices \u2013 cinnamon, cloves, cardamoms and bay leaf., \u25a2, When they begin to sizzle add the onions and green chili. Saute until they turn light golden., \u25a2, Add ginger garlic paste and saute for a minute without burning., \u25a2, Add tomatoes and salt. Let cook until mushy, pulpy and thick., \u25a2, Stir in red chilli powder, turmeric, garam masala, coriander powder and cumin powder. Saute until the masala begins to smell good, for about 3 to 4 mins., \u25a2, Optional \u2013 If you want a smooth curry, cool this, discard the bay leaf, green chili and cinnamon. Blend in a blender to a smooth or coarse paste to suit your liking. I prefer to blend in 2 tbsps cooked chana along with the onion tomato masala. Add that puree back to the pan., \u25a2, Add the chana along with the chana stock or water (1\u00bc cups). Pour another \u00be to 1 cup water., If you don't puree the onion tomato masala, you will require lesser water., If using canned chickpeas, drain and rinse them before adding with 1\u00be cups water., \u25a2, Mix well. Taste test and add more salt. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes., \u25a2, When the consistency is thick (check pics), add amchur powder (optional) and kasuri methi., \u25a2, Garnish Chana masala with coriander leaves. Sprinkle some lemon juice if required. Serve with, Basmati Rice, , Jeera Rice, Naan or Chapati., Instant Pot Chana Masala, \u25a2, To make the recipe in Instant pot, make the onion tomato masala on saute mode. Optionally If you want you may cool and blend this. Add the soaked chickpeas with 2 cups water. Deglaze and Pressure cook on high for 35 minutes. When the pressure drops, open the lid. Cook on a saute mode for a few minutes until thick. Add kasuri methi and amchur., , , Notes, , This recipe has been updated recently to make it simpler. If you prefer a chunky gravy do not blend the onion tomato masala. For a little texture, make a coarse paste & for a smoother curry blend it to a smooth paste., , Use a good fragrant garam masala to make a flavorsome curry. Adjust the quantity of ground spices to suit your taste. If your garam masala is too strong, you may cut down by 1/4 teaspoon., , Whole spices can be skipped but they add an extra layer of flavors. If you wish to blend the onion tomato masala, discard bay leaf and cinnamon., , Ginger and garlic to be used in equal quantities. You can also use only 1 tbsp ginger\u00a0 and skip garlic., , If using bottled tomato puree, You may need more ground spices to balance the extra tart flavor., , , , Video, , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Authentic Chana Masala (Chickpea Masala), , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 193, , Calories from Fat 81, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 9g, 14%, Saturated Fat 1g, 6%, Trans Fat 1g, Polyunsaturated Fat 3g, Monounsaturated Fat 5g, Sodium, 519mg, 23%, Potassium, 511mg, 15%, Carbohydrates, 24g, 8%, Fiber 7g, 29%, Sugar 8g, 9%, Protein, 6g, 12%, , , Vitamin A, 1131IU, 23%, Vitamin C, 25mg, 30%, Calcium, 70mg, 7%, Iron, 3mg, 17%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , , , 23.8K, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Meat Recipes, , Butter Chicken Recipe (Indian Chicken Makhani), Chicken Korma Recipe, Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Biryani Recipe, Chicken Curry Recipe, , , , , About Swasthi, , I\u2019m Swasthi Shreekanth, the recipe developer, food photographer & food writer behind Swasthi\u2019s Recipes.

This recipe turned out excellent and way better than I expected. I had fond memories of eating chana masala with fried bread every morning when I lived in India for 6 months. I had accompanied my husband while he was on work to India. Chana masala with puri and halwa was my staple breakfast at a nearby restaurant. I was looking for a authentic recipe and this one worked well. However I could not find kasuri methi so had to omit that.

I am planning to make this 2 days ahead for an event. I am using six 15 oz cans of chickpeas but they are not tender like the pressure cooked chana. Should I boil them with fresh water as mentioned in the tips? If so for how long and do I use the same water to make the masala. Would you also triple the whole spices? Please reply, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Teja, , , , March 12, 2025 4:25 pm, , , , , , Hi Teja,, Simply add little 1/4 teaspoon baking powder or a large pinch of baking soda to the chickpeas and boil them until tender. Drain and use in the recipe. If you don\u2019t mind the leavening agent in your dish, you can also add it directly to the masala while cooking. You don\u2019t need to triple the whole spices, use 2x.

But none came close to this one. This one tastes and feels like it came from a fancy upscale restaurant and has a nice punch of flavors. I use canned chickpeas and whole peeled tomatoes. Added a pinch of soda bicarbonate to cut down the acid and to soften my chickpeas. It turns out delish! I also made your garam masala which super aromatic.

If you use dried chickpeas next time, you can use baking soda at the time of cooking them. Use the same water to cook down the sauce. This cut down the acidic taste of tomatoes.

I prefer using avocado or olive oil suitable for sauteing and grilling., , , , , , Recipe Substitutions/Variations, , , Raw almonds - Use whole almonds instead of cashews to thicken the sauce. Add some water and then boil/blanch them in the microwave for 3 mins. This helps to loosen the skin.

I could eat this every day., , Thank you!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Emily, , says, , , August 23, 2022 at 11:20 pm, , , , I found that this was a good starting base recipe but I made a few modifications since I like it to be a bit more spice-y and didn't have cashews in my pantry. This is definitely being added to my rolodex of meals. \ud83d\ude42, , - Substituted the cashews (and the creaminess they would provide) for 1/2 cup of greek yogurt and 1/2 cup of milk. It gave it a slightly more tangy flavor but I liked that and it also provided some creaminess/thickness., - Doubled all the spices in the sauce. I'm used to a heavier use of spices in my food and when I initially made this with the provided measurements, I found that it was quite light in its' flavors. This may not work for everyone, but don't be afraid to double up! \ud83d\ude42, - Instead of plain water and salt, I mixed in the cup of water with tomato & chicken bouillon. It still provided the salt but with a bit more flavor to the sauce overall., - I added 1 teaspoon of turmeric, mainly to get a brighter color., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Chelsey, , says, , , June 27, 2023 at 5:19 pm, , , , I also wound up doubling all of the seasonings, for instance) because I made this on a whim and didn\u2019t have them. Also subbed tomatoes with tomato juice. Hadn\u2019t thought of yogurt for creaminess, that\u2019s a good idea! I just didn\u2019t add cashews and it turned out perfectly fine., , I\u2019ve tried a few chana masala recipes and this is the best one I\u2019ve had so far!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Chelsey, , says, , , June 27, 2023 at 5:20 pm, , , , *subbed most, , Don\u2019t know how \u201cuse\u201d got in there. \ud83d\ude05, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , Katie, , says, , , August 07, 2021 at 8:56 pm, , , , I am super excited to try this recipe! One question though: I have some tikka masala spice in my cabinet. Could I use that instead of the garam masala in this recipe?

Also had to sub in a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes for the tomato portion since I didn't have any fresh. My kids who can be fairly picky eaters loved it. Three of us had no problems polishing it off, need to possibly double next time to have leftovers., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Debra Cochran, , says, , , July 10, 2021 at 8:56 pm, , , , This was absolutely delicious!

        "Kala Chana Sabji": "Ingredients: onions, tomatoes, garlic and spices make up the bulk of this tasty Punjabi dish., , If you are a fan of black chickpeas, then you should also try this spicy, Kadala Kari, from the Kerala cuisine., , About My Recipe, , This yummy family recipe came to me from my mother-in-law. Her recipes are always simple, easy and delectable. This Kala Chana recipe is no exception, requiring just one pot and 30 minutes of active time to make., , I am particularly fond of the consistency of this Kala Chana curry. Because it is so flavorful it can be enjoyed by itself like a soup, or be paired with steamed rice or roti for a more filling meal., , This Kala Chana recipe can also be adjusted to your taste preferences. We like our curries to be at least moderately spicy, but if you prefer a more mild dish, simply pull back on how much chili you add to the gravy., , While we always use dried chana to make curries (which requires that they soak overnight), you can opt to use canned chickpeas instead if you are short on time. Just note that dried beans will always be less expensive than canned., , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to Make Kala Chana, , In the step-by-step guide, I explain making the Kala Chana recipe in a pressure cooker.  Do not have a pressure cooker? Not to worry., , , 1. Rinse 1 cup black chickpeas (kala chana) a couple of times in water. Then add 2.5 cups water and soak the kala chana overnight or for 8 to 9 hours., , After the black chickpeas have softened and become tender from the soaking, drain the extra water. Using a strainer, rinse the soaked chickpeas in water for a couple of times and set aside., , , , 2. In a 3 litre pressure cooker, add 2 tablespoons oil or ghee (clarified butter)., , , , 3. When the oil becomes hot, lower the heat. Add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera). Let them crackle., , , , 4. Once the cumin seeds crackle, then add \u00bd cup finely chopped onions (about 1 medium-sized onion)., , , , 5. Saut\u00e9 the onions stirring often until they become golden. Saut\u00e9 onions on a medium-low to medium heat., , , , 6. Lower the heat again. Add 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger, and 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies or serrano pepper., , , , 7. Saut\u00e9 for 10 to 12 seconds or until the raw aroma of the ginger and garlic goes away., , , , Saut\u00e9 Tomatoes, , 8. Add 1.25 cups finely chopped tomatoes (about 2 medium tomatoes or 1 large tomato)., , , , 9. Saut\u00e9 them on medium-low heat until the oil starts leaving the sides of the onion-tomato masala and the tomatoes begin to soften. You should see the tomatoes becoming mushy and pulpy., , Tip:, , Swap fresh tomatoes with tomato puree or canned tomatoes. Crush the canned tomatoes before you add them. For tomato puree, add about \u00bd cup + 2 tablespoons of it., , , , 10. Add \u00bc teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing),1 teaspoon coriander powder and 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder., , NOTE: If you are gluten sensitive, please be sure to purchase a gluten free brand of asafoetida, or simply omit it. Many commercially available brands are processed with wheat., , , , 11. Mix well and saut\u00e9 for a minute on a low heat., , , , Add Water & Pressure Cook Kala Chana, , 12. Add the kala chana together with 1.5 cups water., , , , 13. Season with salt as required and mix again., , , , 14. Pressure cook kala chana on a medium heat for 10 to 11 minutes or 10 to 12 whistles (or more, if needed), until the kala chana are cooked well and softened., , If the black chickpeas are undercooked, pressure cook further for 5 minutes more., , Tip 1:, , If there is too much liquid in the gravy, then cook the chana without the lid until some water evaporates. You can also mash a few chana pieces for the gravy to thicken., , Tip 2:, On occasions when I have time, I blend a ladle (roughly \u00bc cup) of the cooked kala chana with some water to make a medium-thick paste and add it to the gravy. Mix this paste with the curry and simmer for a couple of minutes. This technique makes the curry taste fabulous and is one tip I highly recommend., , , , 15. When you get the desired consistency, sprinkle \u00bd teaspoon garam masala. Mix well., , , , 16. Add 1 to 2 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (optional) to the Punjabi kala chana curry., , , , Serving Suggestions, , Serve the Kala Chana curry hot with Indian breads \u2013, Roti, or, Paratha, or, Poori, . Or enjoy it as a soup with some toasted bread. Pair with soft dinner rolls to soak the delicious gravy., , Rice is another best option to serve kala chana with. Use your preferred rice \u2013, Basmati Rice, or any variety. Flavored rice recipes like, Jeera Rice, (cumin rice), , Ghee Rice, are a few more options., , Storage, , Leftover kala chana curry keeps well in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. Before serving, heat the curry in a pan and then serve it with a side of your choice., , , , Ingredient Notes, , Black Chickpeas:, Make use of fresh chickpeas that are within their shelf life for the best taste and texture while making the Kala Chana recipe. Older or aged chickpeas will take a longer time to cook and won\u2019t result in a flavorful curry., , Soaking:, Black chickpeas have a tougher skin, so I always suggest to soak them overnight for about 8 hours. Soaking also ensures that the chickpeas are softened and cooked well, which makes them easy to digest., , Tomatoes:, Out of fresh tomatoes? Use canned tomatoes. Crush the tomatoes prior to cooking them. If replacing with tomato puree, add \u00bd cup + 2 tablespoons of it., , Spicing:, We prefer our kala chana to be moderately spiced. If you prefer a less spicy version, reduce the green chillies and red chilli powder or cayenne pepper., , Consistency:, The consistency of the curry can be changed as you like. For a soupy and slightly thin consistency, add a bit of more water. For a thicker consistency, add less water. Punjabi kala chana has a medium-thin to thin consistency and is not thick., , Instant Pot Kala Chana, , First rinse and soak the black chickpeas for 8 to 9 hours. Drain the water and again rinse a few times with fresh water.

Lastly add the coriander leaves and garam masala., , FAQs, , Is kala chana same as chickpeas?, , Basically there are few kinds of chickpeas. Kala chana (desi chana) is a smaller sized chickpea having a brown husk while white chickpea (kabuli chana) is larger in size having creamish-white husks., There are also chickpea variants which have green husks (, hara chana, ) and dark black husks (a local rare variant)., , , How can I thicken my curry gravy?, , There are a few ways to achieve this. First, you can simmer the gravy and chickpeas with no lid after the pressure has been released from the pressure cooker. This will help to evaporate some of the excess liquid., Secondly, you can opt to mash or blend a ladle-full of the chana. Add the mashed chickpeas back to the gravy and simmer on low. This will release some of the starch into the gravy, which should then thicken the sauce., Finally, you can opt to add a tablespoon or two of roasted besan (or chickpea flour) to the mix, stirring well to combine., , , Can I make kala chana ahead of time?, , Absolutely.

While the tikka masala is slow cooking, place cashews in a bowl of water and set aside. A few minutes before the slow cooker is done, drain and rinse the cashews.

To save time on busy mornings, I skip the saut\u00e9ing step., , The night before,, , Make the spice blend, cover and put aside., Prepare the onion, garlic, ginger, potatoes, bell pepper and jalape\u00f1o., Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Measure out 1 cup of frozen green peas and 2 cups of tomato pur\u00e9e., Place the vegetables, chickpeas and green peas in a large freezer bag or large sealable storage container and top with the tomato pur\u00e9e. Place in the refrigerator., Be sure to put the diced potato on the bottom, . Cut potato starts to darken when exposed to oxygen, so the goal is to keep the potato as air tight as possible. I\u2019ve never had an issue with potatoes darkening when I store them this way overnight, but if you want to be extra safe, you can store the diced potato in a separate container, covered with water. You\u2019ll have the extra step of draining the potatoes in the morning., Place the cashews in a glass or container and cover with water. Put in the refrigerator to soak., In the morning, dump the entire freezer bag into the slow cooker, When you get home, follow the final step of the recipe below (adding cashew cream and lemon juice)., , , Other vegan recipes you may enjoy, , Creamy Vegan One Pot Pasta, Thai Pumpkin Curry, Pasta with Creamy Vegan Butternut Squash Sauce, Quinoa and Chickpea Salad with Lemon Dill Dressing, Southwest Sweet Potato, Kale and Black Bean Skillet, , , , , Slow Cooker Potato & Chickpea Tikka Masala, , , Laura Lawless, BASc, , , Potato and Chickpea Tikka Masala is a comforting vegan dish to enjoy as the weather gets cooler.

I love the sound of this recipe however, my Family are not big fans of chickpeas. Is it possible to substitute with Something like black beans, or kidney beans? I\u2019m really looking forward to making this recipe!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Laura Lawless, BASc, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Hi Barbara, I think white beans might be the best bet, perhaps kidney beans. Just note it will change the texture of the dish. If your family likes tofu, you could also try that (small-diced extra firm variety)., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Sarah, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Sadly, this recipe was a huge miss for me. I followed the recipe to a T, but it ended up incredibly watery. I had to add cornstarch and Greek yogurt to thicken and even then, it didn\u2019t reach the correct consistency. Even after four hours on high, the potatoes were quite hard. Also, it was quite bland. Not sure how that could be with all the spices, but it didn\u2019t taste like much. Bummed I have yet to find a recipe that comes close to takeout., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Laura Lawless, BASc, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Hi Sarah, here are some thoughts:, , 1. Diced potatoes should definitely be cooked after 4 hours on High, so this isn\u2019t a recipe issue (many recipes have similar timing). I wonder if you were using a traditional slow cooker with the heavy insert, or if you used the Instant Pot or another type of multicooker. Often the slow cook on these cookers need a lot more time. This may also explain how you had a watery result \u2013 if the cooker didn\u2019t get hot enough to cook the potatoes, it would affect the overall finished texture., , 2. Flavour \u2013 you\u2019re right, tons of spice is added to this recipe! Often when we feel like the flavours aren\u2019t coming through, you need to add more salt. I don\u2019t over-salt the starting point of my recipes as it\u2019s always easier to add than take away and it\u2019s such a personal preference. With any recipe you\u2019re trying, if you feel the flavour isn\u2019t there, salt is your friend!, , Best of luck as you try new recipes!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Dylan, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I loved your story.

If so, how long?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Laura Lawless, BASc, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Hi Meredith, low setting should be fine! I would do 6 hours to make sure the potatoes are cooked through., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Sue, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Can this be frozen?  Completely make the recipe then freeze for later?

I used coconut milk instead of cashew and it was the best., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Lou Rodewald, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I made this last night for my family.  They LOVED IT!  I might add that I did cut up tofu, warmed it up and my daughters and I added it in our bowl. My husband had some cut up beef in his. So, this recipe works great for mixed families with vegan, vegetarian, and non vegan/vegetarian.  I used Lite Coconut milk and probably would have been thicker with regular but I didnt have any on hand.  I didn\u2019t add the jalepenos or the cayenne since my girls and I don\u2019t like spicy.  There was enough heat with just as is with your spice blend. Definitely a keeper and I think next time I will add some cauliflower as well.   Again, wonderful recipe!  Thank you!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Susan Mulligan, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I made the recipe on my stovetop, and let it simmer all day. I followed the recipe but left out the sugar. I thought I might add some shredded carrots to take out the acidity of the tomatoes but I didn\u2019t.  It was so excellent. Like beyond belief good. Thank you!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Mai, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I think this is the best slow cooker recipe I\u2019ve ever used. If I could give it 6 stars I would. It tasted amazing, somehow satisfying the tastes of my normally meat-loving husband AND my toddler (who\u2019s going through a picky phase) and myself. Not only that, but by skipping the jalape\u00f1o I made it into a puree for my 6-month old who ALSO loved it! NOT ONLY THAT, but I also made it in the easiest way possible. Did I saut\u00e9 anything? No! Did I use real onion? No! I used dehydrated onion \u2013 like a monster. Did I redeem myself by making the cashew cream? Again, NO! I jumped straight to the canned coconut milk substitute. I feel like I entered a parallel universe where each lazy step took me further down the path towards deliciousness instead of away from it. I literally have my second portion of the day sitting on the table, waiting for me, and I\u2019m already craving a third bowl. *chef\u2019s kiss* Magic!, P.S.

Thank you!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Laura Lawless, BASc, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Hi Claire, I haven\u2019t tried doubling this one myself, but you should be fine with about 6 hours on high (as long as it all fits in your slow cooker, I used a 6 quart). You just want to make sure the potatoes are cooked until tender, so I would start testing for doneness around 5-5.5 hours. Let us know how it goes!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Claire, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Thank you! Ended up just making one serving because my crockpot was too small for doubling the recipe.
