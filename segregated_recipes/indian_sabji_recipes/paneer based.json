        "Paneer Lababdar": "Ingredients: , , , Paneer (Indian cottage cheese):, This is the main ingredient in the dish and it is important to use a good quality paneer. In fact, as with all my paneer recipes, I recommend using, Homemade Paneer, , Tomatoes:, Giving the dish a bit of tang, tomatoes are an important ingredient in the gravy. Be sure to choose tomatoes that aren\u2019t too tangy or sour., , Cashews:, The creamy consistency in paneer lababdar comes from cashews. The cashews are ground to a paste with the tomatoes. Cashews also add a lovely sweetness to the dish., , Cream:, Adding cream also adds to the sweetness and richness in the gravy making it a restaurant style dish., , Onions:, In the curry, onions are not pureed, but chopped and lightly caramelized. Thus they add some sweetness and a slight sharp flavor to the curry., , Spices and Herbs:, Most of the spices and herbs used in this recipe are common and you probably already have them in your kitchen. The garam masala powder can be purchased, but is also a great spice to make from scratch and have on hand. Here I share the recipe for making, Garam Masala Powder, ., , , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to make Paneer Lababdar, , Preparation, , , , 1.5 cups chopped tomatoes (Use tomatoes that are not too tangy or sour), , 10 to 12 cashews, , 1 inch chopped ginger, , 2 to 3 chopped garlic cloves (medium-sized), , 1 green cardamom, , 2 cloves, , \u00bd\u00a0cup water, , , , , 2. Switch on the stovetop and simmer this mixture on a low heat., , , , 3. Cook until the tomatoes are softened. If the water dries up and the tomatoes are not softened, then add about 2 to 3 tablespoons water and continue to cook. When I cooked, almost all the water had evaporated., , , , , , , 5. Grind or blend to a smooth paste. There should not be any cashews or tomato chunks in the paste., , You may add some water if required while grinding or blending. Set this ground tomato-cashew-spices paste aside., , , , Saut\u00e9ing onions and tomato paste, , 6. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a pan, kadai or wok. You can also use ghee (clarified butter) or a neutral-tasting oil., , Heat the butter on a low to medium heat ensuring that it does not burn., , , , 7. Add 1 tej patta (Indian bay leaf) and saute for a couple of seconds., , , , 8. Add \u00bd cup finely chopped onions., , , , 9. Stir and mix well., , , , 10. Then continue to saute as well as stir and cook until the onions become light golden or golden on medium-low to medium heat., , , , 11. Then add the tomato-cashew-spices paste. The mixture will splutter if there is water in it, so be careful., , , , 12. Stir and mix thoroughly., , , , 13. Add the following ground spice powders:, , , \u00bd teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin), , \u00bd teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander), , \u00bd teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper, , , , , 14. Stir the ground spices. Saute this masala on low to medium-low heat. You will see the masala clumping and gathering around itself., , , , 15. Saut\u00e9 until you see fat leaving the sides of the masala paste. The masala will also look glossy and shiny., , , , Making Paneer Lababdar, , 16. Then add 1 cup of water to the perfectly sauteed masala., , , , 17. Mix very well., , , , 18. Add 1 or 2 slit green chilies., , , , 19. Stir and allow the gravy to come to a simmer on medium-low to medium heat., , , , 20. Then season with salt according to your taste preferences., , , , 21. Add sugar. I added \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon of sugar but you can add as per your taste., , , , 21. Add 200 grams paneer which has been cut into cubes or squares. Also add 2 tablespoons grated paneer., , Here I used fresh homemade paneer. If using frozen paneer, then keep it in warm water for some minutes and then slice as well as grate it., , , , 22. Gently mix and switch off the heat., , , , 23. Then sprinkle 1 teaspoon kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves) which have been crushed along with \u00bc teaspoon garam masala powder. Mix very well again., , , , 24. Add \u00bc cup low fat cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream., , , , 25.

This is optional., , , , 26. Garnish paneer lababdar with chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and ginger julienne., , Paneer labadar goes very well with Indian flatbreads, including roti, naan, or pudina paratha. Also, this creamy gravy can be served with jeera rice or vegetable pulao., , , , FAQs, , Can I use canned tomatoes or tomato puree?, , Yes definitely. Add 1.5 cups of canned tomatoes while blending cashews. You do not need to cook the canned tomatoes with cashews. For tomato puree, add \u00be cup of it directly when saut\u00e9ing with the cashew paste. You just need to make the cashew and spices paste if you use tomato puree., , , What can I use instead of kasuri methi?, , Kasuri methi are dried fenugreek leaves. If you don\u2019t have them, just skip them., , , Can I make paneer lababdar without onion and garlic?, , Yes of course! To get the mild flavors of onion and garlic without actually using them in the recipe, add 1 pinch of asafetida or hing (that is if you have it) when saut\u00e9ing the tomato-cashew paste., , , Can I skip cream?, , Yes you can easily skip adding cream., , , Can i use malai?, , Malai which is the clotted cream that collects on the top of boiled milk has to be whipped to a smooth flowing consistency before you add it to the gravy., , , What can I replace cashews with?, , Add almonds which have been blanched in hot water for 30 minutes with their peels removed., , , , , For tomato-cashew paste, \u25a2, 1.5, , cups, , chopped tomatoes, , (ripe and red), 250 grams, \u25a2, 10 to 12, , cashews, \u25a2, 1, , inch, , ginger, , \u2013 chopped, \u25a2, 2 to 3, , garlic, , (medium-sized) \u2013 chopped, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , water, \u25a2, 1, , green cardamom, \u25a2, 2, , cloves, \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , Butter, \u25a2, 1, , tej patta, , (Indian bay leaf), \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , finely chopped onions, , \u2013 100 grams, \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , cumin powder, , (ground cumin), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , Coriander Powder, , (ground coriander), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , red chili powder, , or kashmiri red chili powder or cayenne pepper, \u25a2, 1 or 1.25, , cups, , water, , or add as required, \u25a2, 1 or 2, , green chilies, , or serrano peppers \u2013 slit, \u25a2, salt, , as required, \u25a2, \u00bc to \u00bd, , teaspoon, , sugar, , or add as required, \u25a2, 200, , grams, , Paneer, , (cottage cheese), \u25a2, 2, , tablespoon, , grated paneer, \u25a2, \u00bc, , teaspoon, , Garam Masala, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , kasuri methi, , (dry fenugreek leaves) \u2013 crushed, \u25a2, \u00bc, , cup, , low-fat cream, , or 1 to 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , Butter, , added later \u2013 (optional), For garnish, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , chopped coriander leaves, , (cilantro leaves), \u25a2, 1, , inch, , ginger, , \u2013 julienne, , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark while making the recipe,  Instructions: , , , How do I make a vegan recipe of paneer lababdar?, , Replace firm tofu, seitan, tempeh with paneer.

Thank you for the recipe. My question is that in some recipe I have seen dry Kashmiri chili added to make the paste. Does adding this change the flavor of the dish and only makes it more spicy?

Kashmiri chillies will change the taste and flavor of the dish but it will it give a nice red or orange color. The spiciness will depend on how many Kashmiri chillies are added in these recipes., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ash, , says:, , , , Aug 25, 2020 at 9:10 pm, , , , , Thank you for your feedback!
