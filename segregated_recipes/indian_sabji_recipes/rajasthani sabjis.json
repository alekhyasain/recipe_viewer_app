It gives a slight tanginess., , Poppy Seeds, : A teaspoon of poppy seeds give a wonderful crunch and flavor to the Aani., , , Gravy, , Onion:, I use red onions, but white ones will work too. Use a chopper to make work easy., , Tomato, : I prefer to roughly blend the tomatoes for this gravy., , Herbs and Spices, : I have used ginger, green chilly, and the basic everyday spices like turmeric, red chilly powder, and coriander powder. A pinch of Garam Masala enhances the flavor of the curry., , , How to make Sindhi Aani Bassar, , To make Sindhi Aani Basaar, first, we will make the Aani., , Aani, , First, soak the poppy seeds for about an hour. Use a thin sieve to drain the water., Now take besan in a wide bowl. Add chopped onions, green chili, coriander leaves, poppy seeds, dry pomegranate seeds, salt, and oil., , Mix everything very well. Rub in the oil so the flour resembles breadcrumbs. Knead the dough adding water gradually. The dough should be stiff., Next, pinch out small balls, the size of a small lemon, and flatten them to shape them into a tikki. We call these tikki Aani., Heat oil in a kadai and fry the Aani in medium to hot oil. Do not add all the tikkis at a time, they might disintegrate. Fry the tikkis till golden. Keep aside. Let them come to room temperature., , Now immerse them in water. ( This is a tip that my mom taught ) The Aanis absorb water and become soft., Alternatively, we add the fried Aanis., , Next, we will make the gravy, ., , Aani | Tikki, 2, , cup, , Besan / Gram Flour, 1, , Onion, , finely chopped, 2, , Green Chilly, , finely chopped, 1/4, , cup, , Coriander Leaves, , finely chopped, 1, , teaspoon, , Poppy Seeds, 1, , teaspoon, , Dry Pomogranate Seeds/ Anardana, 4, , tablespoon, , Oil, Salt to taste, Water to knead, Oil to Fry the  Aani, Gravy, 4, , tablespoon, , Oil, 8, , Onions, , chopped, 1, , teaspoon, , Ginger Paste, 6, , Tomato, , chopped, 2, , Green Chilli, , finely chopped, 1, , teaspoon, , Coriander Powder, 1/8, , teaspoon, , Turmeric Powder, 1/2, , teaspoon, , Red Chilly Powder, 1/2, , teaspoon, , Garam Masala, Salt to Taste,  Instructions: Seyal., , Heat about 4 tablespoons of oil in a pan.

Simmer the flame., , ( If you are using fried tikkis we will still add them at the same time and sprinkle a little water over them, cover with a lid, and cook similarly. Add tomatoes only after the tikki is soft., , After 10-12 minutes the onions become soft. Remove the lid and now add tomatoes, coriander powder, and red chilly powder. Give a gentle stir, so everything combines well. Put back the lid and let the tomatoes cook., , After about 5 minutes or till the tomatoes are mushy increase the flame and cook till all the moisture is absorbed.

        "Tamatar ka Choka": "Ingredients: sattu as an individual ingredient, has a lot of health benefits too., , One of the noteworthy ones being its cooling properties. Thus, it is a preferred choice of ingredient in areas with extreme weather conditions during summers., , Litti Chokha together forms a really brilliant combo consisting of varied flavors and textures. An original recipe for any chokha will have the main vegetable (brinjal, potato or tomato) being roasted or boiled, then skinned off (if needed)., , garlic, green chilies, coriander leaves, salt, lemon juice and a generous quantity of mustard oil., , , , You can even make a chokha combining all the 3 veggies or combine just the baingan and tamatar to make one chokha. I have shared the recipes of Baingan Ka Chokha (made with eggplants), , , Tomato Chokha, , (made with tomatoes) in this post., , For the chokha made with potatoes, check the recipe here of, Aloo Chokha, , To prepare this chokha, you will need bharta baingan or the large dark purple aubergine or eggplant.

It is one of the most popular street foods as well in Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh in North India., , During my travels to this side of the country, I did find a lot of street stalls serving Litti Chokha., , About Litti Recipe, , I had seen quite a few ways of preparing both the Litti and chokha on various YouTube channels. But finally, I made them in my own way and this post shares exactly that. For the stuffing of the Litti, usually, Red Chilli Pickle, or, Mango Pickle, is added., , As I wanted to do something different, I added some similar spices and not the pickles itself. You can definitely use the North Indian style mango or red chili pickle masalas, if you have it at home., , both are miles apart and have distinct flavors in them., , To get the most authentic feel, it is best to serve the Litti with a chokha. Hence, inspite of being easy to make, the recipe is time consuming as you will have to prepare the elements one by one. So, you must take your own pace and time in doing so, and not rush into it., , For the stuffing of the Litti, sattu or roasted black chickpea flour is the primary ingredient. If you don\u2019t have it at home, then use roasted chana dal without husk and grind it. Then, sift the flour and use it for this Litti Recipe., , Traditionally, these wheat dough balls in a Litti Chokha are roasted on hot charcoal or dried cow dung fire. This also makes the flavor, a typical one., , Although at homes, an oven can be used to bake the Litti. If you have a charcoal-based open grill, then you can even use that for roasting. The Litti can be roasted on a tawa or fried too., , Ways to cook Litti, , , Baking in oven:, This post mentions this way of cooking., Roasting on tawa:, Flatten the shaped Littis and roast them on a hot tawa on low flame. You have to cook these till you see charred spots on them., Grilling on tandoor:, If doing so, grill till they are cooked and slightly charred., Deep frying in oil:, For doing so, shape them like kachoris and deep-fry in hot oil. Make sure to seal them properly or else they can disintegrate or fall apart while being fried., Step-by-Step Guide, , How to make Litti Chokha, , Prepare Dough For Litti, , 1. In a mixing bowl, take\u00a02 cups (240 grams) whole wheat flour (atta),\u00a0\u00bc teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon ghee or oil., , , , 2. Add water in parts and begin to knead. I added \u00be cup water. Depending on the quality of flour, you can add \u00be to 1 cup water., , , , 3. Knead to a smooth and soft dough. Cover the dough and set aside the dough to rest., , , , Make Stuffing, , 1. In a mortar-pestle, take \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera) and \u00bd teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf).\u00a0Lightly crush and keep aside., , , , 2. Take\u00a01 cup roasted gram flour or roasted black chickpea flour (sattu) in a mixing bowl or pan., , , , 3. Add the crushed\u00a0cumin seeds and fennel seeds., , , , 4. Now, add \u00bd teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain), \u00bd teaspoon nigella seeds (kalonji) and \u00bd teaspoon red chili powder., , , , 5. Next, add\u00a01 to 2 teaspoons chopped green chilies,\u00a01 teaspoon finely chopped ginger and\u00a01\u00a0teaspoon finely chopped garlic., , , , 6. Add\u00a02 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves, \u00bc teaspoon black salt and regular salt as per taste., , , , 7. Add 2\u00a0teaspoons lemon juice., , , , 8. Next, add 2\u00a0teaspoons mustard oil., , , , 9. Mix very well., , , , 10. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons water all over and mix the flour with water evenly. Add more water, if required., , The stuffing mixture should not be too dry or too wet. If the mixture is\u00a0dry, then the dryness is felt while eating Littis., , , , Assemble, Shape and Make Litti, , 11. After the dough has rested for 30 minutes, make small or medium sized balls from the dough., , , , roll each dough ball to a circle of about 5 to 6 inches., , , , 13. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing in the center., , , , 14. Pleat and join the edges., , , , 15.\u00a0Press the joined part and lightly roll the stuffed dough balls in your palms, so as to get a round shape. Keep aside., , , , , , , 17. Now, place the stuffing., , , , 18. Gently bring together the outer dough cover\u00a0in the center,\u00a0while pressing the stuffing. Join and seal the edges., , This is a bit tricky. So, , , , so that the dough does not dry out., , , , Bake Litti, , 20. Place the prepared Littis on a baking tray, which has been greased with some oil. Grease baking tray well, otherwise the Littis can stick to the tray., , , , 21. Place the tray in the preheated oven at 200\u00b0 C/390\u00b0 F. Preheat the oven at 200\u00b0 C/390\u00b0 F for 20 minutes, prior to baking., , , , 22. After 10 to 15 minutes, remove the tray and flip each Litti.\u00a0Keep the tray back in the oven., , , , 23. Again after 10 to 15 minutes, remove the tray and flip each Litti. Place the tray back in the oven. You will have to do this once or twice more, for even baking., , , , 24. Bake for a total of about 30 to 35 minutes till the crust looks done with some light brown or golden brown spots on them., , Timing will vary upon the size and capacity of the oven. It took me about 40 minutes., , , , 25. Brush them all over with some melted ghee., , , , 26. This step is optional and only to get charred spots on the Litti. Secure it in a pair of tongs and place on fire. Rotate for a few seconds till you see some charred spots on it., , , , 27. Serve the Bihari style Litti with a chokha of your choice accompanied with a small bowl of melted ghee., , The litti is broken, dipped in ghee and then eaten with the chokha. You can also sprinkle some ghee on the Litti and then eat them., , , , Step-by-Step Guide, , Baingan Chokha Recipe, , Baingan ka Chokha or\u00a0Baingan Chokha as it is called in Bihar is a delicious fire-roasted mashed aubergine dish that is served with litti or sattu ka paratha. It is a low fat, gluten-free and vegan dish., , This is a Bihari style delicious baingan chokha and it tastes very different than the Punjabi recipe of, Baingan Bharta, ., , Apart from baingan, , 1. Rinse 1 large baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. Place it on a wired rack on a stovetop or you can place it directly on the stovetop flame., , , , 2. Keep turning the eggplant after 2 to 3 minutes on the flame so that it is evenly cooked., , , , 3. Roast the eggplant till its completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness., , The knife should slid easily in eggplant without any resistance. Remove the eggplant and immerse in a bowl of water till it cools down., , , , 4. Then peel it and chop., , , , 5. Add the chopped eggplant in a mixing bowl along with its juices., , , , 6. Then add \u2153\u00a0cup finely chopped onions, \u00bd teaspoon finely chopped green chilies, \u00bd teaspoon finely chopped garlic and\u00a01 to 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves., , , , 7. Add\u00a01 teaspoon mustard oil. If you want, you can add \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon lemon juice for a slight tang., , , , 8. Season with salt according to taste., , , , 9. Mix everything very well. Check the taste and add more salt, mustard oil and green chilies if required., , , , 10. Serve Baingan ka Chokha with litti or sattu ka paratha or roti or paratha., , , , Step-by-Step Guide, , Tomato Chokha Recipe, , Tomato Chokha is a smoky relish or bharta made from fire roasted tomatoes, herbs and mustard oil. Gluten-free, low fat and vegan., , It is served with litti chokha and as  mentioned above comes from the cuisine of Bihar and Jharkand in India., , Now this Tomato Chokha is not your regular Tomato Bharta.
