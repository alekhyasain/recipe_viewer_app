        "Pav Bhaji": "Ingredients: , , Pav (dinner rolls/ bread rolls), : Indian pav is made with refined white flour, milk and yeast. They are eggless & are easily available in the Indian stores. If you live outside India & don\u2019t find pav, you may serve them with unsweetened buns, sourdough or artisan breads.

You may opt to use pre cut veggies from the stores if you want., , Butter, is the key ingredient that adds flavor to the dish. You may use cultured butter if you have for extra flavor., , Pav Bhaji Masala, is a spice blend used to cook the bhaji. You either make your own following my recipe below or buy from an Indian Store., , , Make Pav Bhaji Masala, , You can buy a store bought bhaji masala from any Indian grocery stores. There are numerous brands selling it and each differs in the flavor and taste. I prefer making my own spice blends because they smell much better and fresher than the store bought versions.

This time I want to make it for a kid\u2019s (my friend\u2019s son) birthday party. Do you have any recommendations on making it healthier? I was looking for your freezer fudge recipe and couldn\u2019t locate. Pls can you also guide me to the recipe.

To make it healthier use whole grain/meal flour artisan or sourdough bread. That makes it much much healthier than using the regular pav. Some kids don\u2019t like the artisan breads due to their crust. If so, simply wrap the bread in a damp cloth for sometime and then brush with hot melted butter. For the bhaji, you may saute fine chopped baby spinach or methi leaves in butter and add to the bhaji. It becomes healthier.

You can simply omit them and use half teaspoon more red chili powder while making the pav bhaji. But if you are aiming for deep red color, as mentioned in the faqs you may use 10 soaked red chilies and omit the chilies mentioned in the spices blend/masala and the chili powder in the recipe.

Probably, it\u2019s hard for a lot of Indians to cross a eatery without surrendering to the temptation. Undeniably, this is the most loved street foods from Mumbai, India!!, , What is Pav Bhaji?, , Pav Bhaji is an Indian fast food consisting of a thick spicy vegetable gravy served with soft dinner rolls. In Hindi and Marathi, the word \u2018Pav\u2019 means \u2018Bread roll or dinner roll\u2019 and \u2018Bhaji\u2019 means \u2018a vegetable dish\u2019. It gets the name since these are served together as a meal., , Originated in Mumbai as a light and quick meal option for the textile workers, this Mumbai\u2019s most iconic street food became hugely popular across India. You will find this everywhere right from upscale restaurants to school/ college canteens & street side push carts in India. Even more you find it in every Indian restaurant abroad. But it is said that you get the BEST Pav Bhaji in Mumbai., , My Recipe, , My homemade version is easier than you think & it tastes incredibly delicious! Except for the preparation, you won\u2019t need to put much effort. Though an all-time favorite, this isn\u2019t the perfect starter instead it is ideal for a meal. Because no one wants to stop with 1 to 2 servings of this., , Bhaji has a m\u00e9lange of vegetables cooked with butter and pav bhaji masala, a special spice blend which creates a magic. The piping hot bhaji is topped with a generous amount of butter and garnished with coriander leaves. It is then served alongside butter toasted pav, chopped onions and lemon wedges. Then you are ready to dip the pav in the bhaji and relish it., , either the stovetop Indian cooker or the instant pot., , , 1. Press SAUTE button on the instant pot. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon oil to the steel insert. I also added half teaspoon cumin seeds here which I have not mentioned in the recipe. These are optional and can be skipped., , , , 2. Add onions and green chilli. Saute until transparent., , , , 3. Spread them in a single layer so they fry quickly., , , , 4. Then stir in ginger garlic and fry for 30 seconds., , , , 5. Add the tomatoes, capsicum and sprinkle salt., , , , 6. Saute until the tomatoes turn soft and mushy. Then add in pav bhaji masala, chilli powder and turmeric., , , , 7. Mix well and add all the veggies \u2013 potatoes, carrots, cauliflower and peas., , , , 8. Pour 2 cups water and deglaze the pot by scrubbing the bottom of the pot with a wooden spatula., , , , 9. Press CANCEL button and press PRESSURE COOK button with high pressure setting. Set the timer to 5 mins and position the steam release handle to sealing. When the IP beeps, wait for 5 mins for natural pressure release. Gently release the rest of the pressure manually., , 10. With a spatula or masher, mash all the veggies well., , , , 11. Press SAUTE button. Taste test. If needed add more salt, red chilli powder and pav bhaji masala. I set aside my kids\u2019 portion and then added more spice powders. Also add kasuri methi., , , , 12. Let the bhaji simmer for 3 to 4 mins. It will thicken., , , , 13. Transfer to serving bowls. Top with butter & coriander leaves., , , , Slit each bun to 2 horizontally. Heat a pan. Smear some butter and sprinkle pav bhaji masala over the butter. (check images above) Toast the pavs until lightly crisp. Alternately you may toast them in a preheated oven. I preheat the oven to 240 C or 460F. Place the butter smeared slit pavs on the baking tray, with the butter side up. Bake them for 2 to 3 mins. Keep watching so they don\u2019t burn & become like biscuit., , Serve pav with hot bhaji, chopped onions and lemon wedges on the side., , , , Faqs, , How to get red color in pav bhaji?, , Street side vendors sometimes add artificial red color. But you can almost get the same color by simply soaking 10 deseeded Kashmiri red chilies in \u00bc cup hot water until soft. Then blend them until smooth.

Thank you for pointing out that the besan has to be throughly roasted before it is added to the mixture \u2026. and also that the addtion should be done in small quantities of single layers, and in measured amounts, so as to avoid unnecesssary coagulation or clumping or caking.  I omitted the coconut, by oversight, but it was all good.  Even your chappati looks delectable in the photograph \u2013 I am sorely tempted to invite myself to your home and table  \u2026 LOL., , My wife, Anjali, loved my Zhunko, and had seconds and thirds, but then she pouted and said, \u201cits not as good as the Zhunko my mother used to make \u2026. !! \u201d   Excuse me, but that was 40 years ago !!?!!, Now can you answer why, our wives feel compelled to compare their hard, persevered, husband\u2019s cooking \u2026.  to their imagination of their  \u201cmother\u2019s cooking\u201d  ????   \u2026. and always depreciating the efforts of their husbands, and  always to the disadvantage of the latter ??  This is meant to be a rhetorical question and no answer is necessary.

        "Aloo Capsicum Sabji": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make aloo capsicum gravy with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , coconut masala paste preparation:, , , , , 6, , aloo capsicum masala preparation:, , , , , 7, , notes:, , , , , , aloo shimla mirch ki sabji | aloo capsicum masala | potato capsicum gravy, the south indian gravy\u2019s are dominated with onion, tomato and coconut masala which makes it thick and rich in texture. one such hugely popular south indian gravy recipe is the aloo capsicum masala recipe known for its flavour and taste., , as i mentioned earlier, there are many variations to the, aloo capsicum gravy, kurma recipe, . it is thick, creamy and also coarse. having said that the same recipe can also be made via north indian style where coconut is skipped. i personally feel the coconut based recipe is much better as the combination of potatoes, capsicum and coconut yields a super tasty recipe., , , furthermore, i would like to highlight some of my tips, suggestions and variations to make this recipe of, aloo capsicum gravy, perfect one. firstly, the timing of adding potatoes and capsicum is very critical for this recipe. you need to add diced potatoes first and it has to be almost cooked before adding the diced capsicums. secondly, i have used dry coconut or also known as, kopra, which adds nice flavour of coconut. having said that you can also add fresh coconut and it should taste equally great. lastly, the gravy tends to thicken once it brought to room temperature or brought to rest. hence you may need to add water before reheating and bring it to right consistency., , finally, i would like to highlight my other, curry or sabji recipes collection, with this post of, aloo shimla mirch ki sabji, . it mainly includes recipes like, potato curry for masala dosa, , , dum aloo, , , jeera aloo, , , kashmiri dum aloo, , , aloo methi, , , aloo gobi masala, , , aloo curry, , , aloo baingan, , , aloo gobi dry, , , dahi aloo, . further,
