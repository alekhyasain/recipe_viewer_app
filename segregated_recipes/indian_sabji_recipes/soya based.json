recipes has always been an integral part of indian cuisine and a must for most of us. it is predominantly used for lunch and dinner as a compliment to the flatbreads like roti, paratha and chapati. it can be done with vegetables, and meat and also with meat like alternatives vegetarian alternatives like meal maker curry recipe known for its significant similarities to the meat curries., , as i was explaining earlier, i have prepared this recipe very similar to the meat curry or chicken/lamb curry. basically, i have included a step to marinate these boiled, soya chunks, with curd, ginger garlic paste and lots of spice powders. this would help to soften/tender and also injects all the spice flavours to the meal maker. generally, we do not marinate vegetables or paneer, but this step ensures the curry is loaded with flavour and spice heat. as a matter of fact, i have posted another variant of the, soya chunks, curry which is similar to any veg or paneer curry. there is no marination with curd and spices and follows the traditional way of preparing the curry. to be honest, once you follow this recipe, you may never go back to the old way. especially the meal maker absorbs the marinated sauce to make it a spice rich curry., , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the, soya chunks recipe, . firstly, even before starting the recipe, you need to make sure the soya chunks are properly boiled in clean water. it may contain a lot of dirt in it and boiling helps to remove that dirt and also reduce the strong smell from the meal maker. secondly, while preparing the gravy, i have used finely chopped onions with tomato puree. this would help to hasten the cooking process. but you can also prepare it with finely chopped tomatoes if you like to get a thick and rough texture to the gravy. lastly, if you feel the spice heat level is too much to handle, you may lower it by adding cooking, cream, or beaten yoghurt. this should be added only once the gravy is prepared and the flame is turned off., , finally, i request you to check my other, curry or sabji recipes collection, with this post of, meal maker curry recipe, . it mainly includes other recipe variants like, onion curry, , , dahi bhindi, , , matar paneer, , , mirchi ka salan, , , karela, , , paneer ki sabji, , , veg tawa fry, , , papaya s, , , salna, , , ridge gourd, . further to

        "Soya Chunks Sabji": "Ingredients: , My Mom always made soya chunks gravy to serve as a side with, vegetable pulao, , , ghee rice, , peas pulao, , biryani, and, kuska rice, . Her soya chunks curry always had bay leaf and many other whole spices in it to mimic the strong non-vegetarian flavors. So you may experiment with bay leaf, cloves and cinnamon for stronger flavors., , More, Soya chunks recipes, Soya Chunks Kurma, Meal Maker stir fry, Soya Chunks Biryani, Soya Manchurian, Meal Maker keema curry, , , Photo Guide, , How to make Soya Chunks Curry (Stepwise Photos), , Preparation, , 1. Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a large pot, , When they soften, drain them and rinse. Squeeze off the excess water from the soya chunks. You will see frothy liquid and it is just normal. Repeat the rinse in fresh water and squeeze again. Repeat the rinse and squeezing off cycle a few times to remove the frothy liquid. This reduces the chances of tummy upset or digestive problems. Keep these aside in a bowl., , , , Make Curry, , 2. Pour 1\u00bd to 2 tablespoons oil to a hot pan. Add cumin and mustard seeds. When they begin to splutter, add 1 sprig curry leaves, 1 slit chili and 1 cup onions. Saute until onions turn golden., , , , 3. While the onions fry, grind 2 medium tomatoes (1\u00bd cup chopped) and 1\u00bc cup coconut to a smooth paste without adding water.  If you do not have coconut, use \u2153 cup thick coconut milk or add 10 cashews or 10 almonds or 2 tbsps almond meal or 2 tbsps roasted gram. Set this aside., , , , 4. When the onions turn golden, add 1\u00bd\u00a0teaspoon ginger garlic paste. Saute until it begins to smell good., , , , 5. Pour the tomato paste from the blender jar. Saute this until the mixture turns thick and the raw smell from tomatoes has gone., , , , 6. Slide the onion tomato masala to a side and add, , , soya chunks, , \u00be to 1 teaspoon red chili powder, , \u00be to 1\u00a0teaspoon garam masala, , 1/8 teaspoon turmeric, , \u00be to 1\u00a0teaspoon coriander powder, , \u00bd teaspoon salt, , , , , 7. Saute all of these till the meal maker blends well with the mixture for about 3 to 4 minutes., , , , 8. Pour 1\u00bc cup hot water and mix well. If required add more water to make a slightly runny gravy. Bring it to a boil and reduce the heat. Cover and cook till the meal maker are soft cooked for about 5 to 8 minutes. If using larger chunks you may cook them a little longer. Taste test and add more salt. When the curry is done, you see it thickens and specks of oil float. Add coriander leaves & turn off the heat., , , , It is best to serve soya chunks curry after 1 to 2 hours of preparing as they soak up and absorb the flavors. Serve soya chunks curry with, Veg biryani, , , pulao, , , jeera rice, , , ghee rice, or, biryani rice/ kuska, ., , , , Pro Tips, , Whole spices:, I have used mustard and cumin seeds in the tempering. For flavour variations, you can instead use 1 bay leaf, 2 cardamoms, 2 cloves, 1 inch cinnamon piece and \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds. If using these spices you may skip curry leaves., , Onion and tomato masala:, For a smoother consistency of the curry, you can also saute onions until golden, followed by chopped ginger garlic for a minute. Then add tomatoes and coconut. Saute until mushy. Cool and blend. In this case you have to use half more cup of water., , Ground spices:, I have also made this recipe several times with kitchen king masala, meat masala and chicken masala. You can try out with any of these to mimic flavors of a meat curry. You need to adjust the quantities as the spice levels vary., , Coconut:, Substitute coconut with 1/3 cup thick coconut milk or cashews or almonds or even with fried gram (roasted chana dal). All work well and cashews are our favourite here., , For extra flavour, , marinate soya chunks with \u00be teaspoon ginger garlic, \u00bd teaspoon red chilli powder & \u00bd teaspoon garam masala. You can rest them for 30 minutes to 1 day in the refrigerator. Saute the soya chunks for 5 minutes in 1 tablespoon oil first and Keep aside. Ensure the raw smell of ginger garlic has gone. Later add them to the simmering gravy., , Serving:, Soya chunks curry is best served after 1 to 2 hours as soya chunks soak up and absorb the flavors. You can also make this ahead and refrigerate., , Combinations:, Soya chunks and green peas is one of the popular combos in many households. You can add some boiled green peas or even potatoes to this recipe., , Faqs, , Are soya chunks healthy?, , Soya chunks if eaten in moderation are healthy since they are a good source of plant protein. However eating it often makes it an unhealthy food as they are highly processed. Too much of protein can also cause stomach upsets., , , Is it good to eat soya chunks every day?, , No! Eat them only 1 to 2 times a week. If you are a meat eater, consume them in place of meat. Consult your dietician for a personalised advice., , , What can be made from soya chunks?, , Soya chunks can be used to make biryani, pulao, fried rice, curries, stir fry dishes, snacks like cutlets, patties and many more. You can also replace meat chunks in any recipe with soya chunks., , , How long should soya chunks be soaked?, , Ideally they need just a 10 to 15 minutes soak to hydrate and soften them. But if you are someone having a trouble digesting protein, then soak them in luke warm water for 3 to 4 hours. Oversoaking in boiling hot water makes them too mushy., , , What are the benefits of soya chunks?, , The main benefit of soya chunks is the ease of cooking. They taste delicious & make a good meat substitute.

Rinse them in cold water twice and repeat squeezing off the excess water. You will get frothy water from the soya chunks, it is just normal. Set this aside for later use., \u25a2, If you are using large chunks you can cut each one to two. Grind the tomatoes and coconut to a smooth paste., How to make Soya Chunks Curry, \u25a2, Heat oil in a pan and add mustard & cumin seeds.\u00a0When they begin to splutter add curry leaves, onions and green chilies., \u25a2, Saute until the onions turn golden. Add ginger garlic paste and fry till the raw smell disappears, for a minute., \u25a2, Add the tomato and coconut puree. Cook till thick and begins to leave the sides of the pan., \u25a2, Stir red chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder, and salt.\u00a0Saute everything well until the spices begin to smell good, for about 3 mins., \u25a2, Next transfer the soya chunks. Saute them for 3 minutes stirring often, till the meal maker are coated well in the masala., \u25a2, Pour hot water and mix well. If the curry is too thick add more water. Bring it to a boil on a high heat & simmer., \u25a2, Cook on a low flame for about 5 to 8 minutes, till soya chunks are cooked well. The oil begins to float on top when the curry is done. Add coriander leaves and mix. Turn off the heat & let rest for at least an hour so the soya chunks soak up the flavors well., \u25a2, Serve soya chunks curry with plain rice, variety rice or roti. We usually squeeze some lemon juice and serve with raw onions, cucumber and carrot slices on the side., , , Notes, , , You can replace garam masala with kitchen king masala or meat masala. For North Indian flavors simply add 1 teaspoon kasuri methi at the last step and use bay leaf instead of curry leaves., , , , It is important to use coconut or cashews as it thickens and won\u2019t let water separate in the gravy. If you do not have coconut you can use, \u2153 cup thick, coconut milk. Blend it with tomatoes. Other options are to use roasted gram (roasted chana dal)., , , , You can also marinate soya chunks with \u00be teaspoon ginger garlic, \u00bd teaspoon red chilli powder and \u00bd teaspoon garam masala. You can rest them for 30 minutes to 1 day in the refrigerator. Saute the soya chunks for 5 minutes in 1 tablespoon oil first and Keep aside. Later add them to the simmering gravy., , , , Soya chunks, potatoes and green peas make a very good combination. You can add about \u00bd to \u00be cup green peas and 1 medium boiled and diced potato., , , , For a healthier and more nutritious dish you can add carrots, peas, cauliflower and bell peppers to the curry. Saute the veggies separately or grill them in the oven or air fry them. Add them to the gravy once it almost done. In this case reduce the soya chunks to 3/4 cup., , , , Soya chunks curry is best served after 1 to 2 hours as soya chunks soak up and absorb the flavors.

In the post, I meant it is not a food to be eaten everyday because it is highly processed. Until recently all the soya chunks sold including in the US, was not from organic soya. They were from gmo soya. This was another concern. I am going to edit that to be clear.

nasta 65, with step by step photo and video recipe. deep-fried snacks or pakoda vadi recipes are some of the popular indian cuisine snacks recipes. it used to be a simple deep-fried fritter, but it has evolved and is now extended with a special lip-smacking spice mix coating applied before and after it is cooked. one such easy and simple street food or meat alternative starter recipe is soya chunks 65 known for its spicy taste combination., , as i was explaining earlier, this recipe is a meat alternative snack recipe. we all know that some chunks carry the same texture and taste like meat and hence it is typically used in mock meat recipes. however, with the special blend of spices and marination, it enhances the texture and the juiciness to make it like to like. if you closely observe the video, particularly in the trailer section, i have shown the softness and sponginess by breaking it. it also shows the internal texture which is an exact copy-paste of meat. this is mainly due to the blend of spices and yoghurt which is absorbed by soya chunks to make it soft. well, these features and properties may be new to strict vegetarians but can be a boon to meat-eaters with someday restrictions. do try this once and let me know your thoughts on the recipe., , , , , , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the, soya chunks 65 recipe, s. firstly, i specifically chose large-sized soya chunks for this recipe so that it can be an ideal alternative to meat. while purchasing, make sure to check its size as it comes in various sizes and shapes. secondly, before it is mixed and marinated, you need to boil and clean it. typically, soya chunks carry a lot of dirt and smell which should eventually get cleaned once it is, boiled, with water and rinsed. lastly, the recipe tastes good with just soya chunks, but you can also try this recipe with soya chaap. basically, soya chaap is a mix of soya chunks and flour so that it gets a rubbery texture. you may follow the same step and procedures to prepare soya chaap 65 recipes., , finally, i request you to check my other related, snacks recipes collection, with this post of, soya chunks 65
