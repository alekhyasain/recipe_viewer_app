Select one with at least 2% fat, plain flavor, and unsweetened. I use the Fage brand. This can\u2019t be substituted with sour cream., , (2) Garam Masala., This is one of those spices that can\u2019t be easily substituted because it gives a characteristic taste to Indian dishes like, chicken tikka masala, . It\u2019s a blend of ground Indian spices including pepper, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and cumin. You can easily buy, garam masala, online, or you can find it at many U.S. supermarkets., , (3) Tomato Sauce., I use plain tomato sauce, sold in cans. Avoid flavored varieties with herbs and other additions. Don\u2019t substitute with pasta sauce., , (4) Heavy Whipping Cream., I haven\u2019t used anything other than dairy-based cream, but readers have told me that they have successfully substituted some or all of the cream with half and half or coconut milk. I think the taste of coconut milk would go wonderfully with the flavors in this dish, especially if you use full-fat coconut milk. For a thicker, luxurious sauce, a better substitution might be coconut cream., , (5) Cayenne., Also known as red pepper, ground cayenne is used to add a bit of heat to the dish. It\u2019s only mildly spicy, so the amount listed in the recipe should be suitable for most people. If you prefer your curries more or less spicy, adjust to taste., , (6) Marinating Time., I prefer to marinate overnight or for at least 8 hours. If you\u2019re short on time, you can reduce the marinating time without a substantial loss in flavor., , (7) Roasting Time., The roasting time for cauliflower florets will depend on your oven, size of cauliflower florets, and taste preferences. If you prefer your cauliflower to be extra tender, bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until it reaches your desired tenderness., , (8) Serving., Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley. This curry is great alongside, creamed spinach, or, mashed turnips, , or wrapped in a low carb tortilla., , (9) Related Dishes., This roasted cauliflower curry is a vegetarian version of my chicken tikka masala recipe, which I have in three versions:, stovetop, ,, slow cooker, , and, pressure cooker, .

If that doesn\u2019t work for you, you can marinate in the morning. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a huge difference in the end., , Don\u2019t use plain yogurt because it\u2019s usually too thin and runny.

You can easily omit it and this recipe will still taste great! I ended up choosing to use coconut milk as the base to keep it slightly coconut in flavor and thick. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t tried this recipe with any other base other than coconut milk, but other vegan options would be I\u2019d suggest using perhaps a combination of your favorite non-dairy plain yogurt (I like Kite Hill or home-made or so-delicious brand) + non-dairy milk (such as unsweetened almond milk (since you\u2019re allergic to cashew milk). However if you try this, you may need to adjust the spices to get the right flavor to come out. Hope that helps a little!

That should wrok, but I\u2019d steam the carrots first. You may get slightly different taste but it should still be tasty. Just keep in mind, i haven\u2019t tried it this way before.

If the tomatoes are different, then it\u2019ll definitely cause a difference in taste. The yellow bell pepper shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.

What an inspired idea to add cashew milk. Yes I like to make my own cashew milk by soaking raw cashews just like you suggest. For me of course it has to be full fat or heavy coconut cream.

With other curry recipes, I\u2019m used to saut\u00e9ing spices with the garlic and ginger and am curious if adding later changes the flavor profile or some other food chemistry purpose?  Thanks so much!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Anjali Lalani, , , February 15, 2024 at 11:53 am, , , , The spices can easily be added with the onions and garlic at the beginning as opposed to afterwards. But for this recipe, since I\u2019m blending everything together, I wanted to add the spices after the sauce was added back in. As the sauce cooks, the dry spices cook along with it. If i wasn\u2019t blending the onions in with the sauce, I would\u2019ve added it earlier. But honestly either way it\u2019ll taste similar., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Sheliza, , , April 13, 2022 at 1:23 pm, , ,  Instructions: To Prepare the Sauce:, In a large non-stick saute pan, heat, 1 tbsp, cooking oil on medium heat., Add in the mustard seeds and allow them to fry for ~30 seconds.
