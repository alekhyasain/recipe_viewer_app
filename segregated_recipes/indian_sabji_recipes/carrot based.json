        "Carrot Poriyal": "Ingredients: , Substitutions, , Substitute fresh coconut with frozen dried coconut, idli podi, peanut podi or sesame podi. If you have none, cool them and powder. Use that to spice your carrot poriyal., , On a medium flame dry roast 2 red chilies, 1 tbsp chana dal and 1 tablespoon urad dal until golden. Then add 1 tbsp sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon dried coconut and 1 teaspoon cumin seeds. Roast for 1 minute., , Cool all of these and make a fine powder with 1 clove of garlic. Use 1 tablespoon or as needed to spice your carrot poriyal just before you turn off the stove., , Variations, , Here are some variations you may want to try., , Add \u00be cup of green peas. A mix of fine chopped veggies like beetroot, beans and peas also go well to make this dish., , Sometimes I soak about \u00bc cup of moong dal (skinned & split yellow beans) for 2 hours in warm water. Drain the water and add it to the pan along with carrots. Cover and cook until tender. If required sprinkle water to provide moisture so the lentils cook well. Moong dal should be fully cooked yet not become mushy., , For a change I also use 100 grams of fine chopped spinach or palak in this recipe., , Pro Tips, , I have chopped the carrots to make this poriyal. However you may also grate it using a thick grater. Avoid using a thin grater as the whole dish becomes mushy. You can also use a food processor., , You may completely skip the lentils in the tempering as aged people and young kids may not like the crunchy dal., , More recipes you may like, Carrot Curry, , Carrot Rice, Easy Carrot Pickle, Beans Poriyal, , , , , Photo Guide, , How to make Carrot Poriyal (Stepwise Photos), , 1. Rinse 250 grams carrots well under running water. Peel them and chop them to bite sized pieces. You can also use a onion or vegetable chopper to dice the carrots., , 2.

Soon the curry leaves will turn crisp then add a pinch of hing (optional), chopped carrots, \u00bc\u00a0teaspoon salt and \u215b\u00a0teaspoon turmeric. Adding salt at this stage is important as it lets the carrot sweat and cook in their own moisture., , , , 5. Stir fry for 2 minutes., , , , 6. Cover and cook on a low heat until carrots become tender. In between keep stirring so they don\u2019t burn. If the carrots are too dry then you may sprinkle some water. Continue to cook covered. If using grated carrots, do not cover and cook. Instead stir fry on a low to medium heat as required until tender., , , , 7. When the carrots are fork tender and not mushy add \u00bc\u00a0cup\u00a0grated coconut and mix well. If you do not have coconut, use the spice powder I mentioned in the intro or sprinkle idli podi or peanut podi. Taste test and add more salt if needed., , , , 8. Stir fry for a minute and turn off.

I also use Staub and triply steel cookware from WFM, Stahl and other brands . Steel cookware are my favorite for everyday use. Since they reflect in the photos and videos I use cast iron cookware more for the website. For anyone who is not going to shoot videos or pictures I highly recommend triply or sandwiched bottom high quality steel cookware.

I did check yesterday so you must have replied later and I missed it \u2013 but thank you for your advice.  Anyway, some advice from my friend in Chennai was to fry the dal in a little oil until golden, then soak for 20 minutes in a little water, then drain and add into the cooking.  There was a nutty earthy flavour which was good and while the dal was obvious in the dish, it was softer., , Thought I might share that with you, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Sandy, , , , September 21, 2020 2:43 pm, , , , , , Hi Sandy,, Yes I am quite late in replying the comments.

I knew the chana dal was going to be a bit challenging on the bit for some.  No problem with the urad dal., , Would dry roasting it beforehand maybe present it a little softer in the dish?  Or replace with chopped cashew nuts?  I love the flavour of the dals but \u2026, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Sandy, , , , September 19, 2020 8:21 am, , , , , , Hi Sandy, Glad to hear that! Yes some cashews will be better. Soaking the lentils doesn\u2019t roast the dals well and the aroma is not same. So I usually temper with the dal and then pour little water. Cook in the pan itself until slightly tender, then add the veggies. I have a teething kid at home. He complains even after cooking them with little water in the tempering. I think skipping is the only option. But cashews will work well too.
