North Indian cuisine has myriad gravy or curries to offer which can be served for day-to-day lunch and dinner. Generally, it is made of locally available vegetables, and paneer and also with a wide range of meat-based options. One such hugely popular yet not considered premium curry is the Lauki ki sabji recipe also known as bottle gourd curry., , I guess I may have explained my situation earlier. We generally have rice for lunch and wheat-based roti or chapati for dinner. This means we typically need to cook twice a day with some curries for rice and another one for dinner. Well, this has been the pattern for quite a long time, but I am looking for some alternative that can be used for both meals., Lauki ki sabji recipe, is one such alternative for me and I make it very frequently. The texture and consistency are very similar to any South indian based sambar and hence taste great when served with any rice options. But primarily an ideal curry to be served with wheat or maida-based indian flatbreads. I like the fact that it becomes juicy and tender when mixed with spicy sauce., , , Furthermore, before jumping into the actual recipe, some tips, suggestions, and variations to the, Lauki ki Sabji recipe, . Firstly, the bottle gourd has to be diced into a medium-sized cube. Do not attempt to lower the size as it may get dissolved in the sauce while cooking the curry. Also, the cubes should not be huge as they may not get cooked properly. Secondly, the same recipe can also be made dry variant without the onion and tomato sauce. I like it when topped with fresh coconut or the south indian variant, but it is completely optional. Lastly, if you wish to make it more creamy, you can add cashew paste or even cooking cream as a topping once the cooking is finished. Hence add it in small portions and taste it before adding the next batch of, cream, ., , Finally, I request you to check my other popular, Curry Recipes Collection, with this post on the, Ghiya ki sabji, recipe. It mainly includes my other related recipes like, Bendekai Gojju, , , Aloo Bhindi, , , Kaju Paneer Masala, , , White Kurma, , , Shahi Paneer, , , Beans ki Sabji, , , Aloo Chole, , , Baby Potato Fry, , , Paneer Hyderabadi, , , Lasooni palak, .

Then soak the chana dal for atleast 30 minutes to 45 minutes., Drain water from the chana dal and keep aside., Making lauki chana dal, Heat oil in a stovetop pressure cooker. Crackle the cumin first., Add the onions and saute stirring often till they become translucent., Add the ginger and green chilies and saute for 10 to 15 seconds., Now add the tomatoes and all the dry spice powders. Saute till the tomatoes soften. Keep on stirring., The oil should start releasing from the onion-tomato masala., Now add the chana dal and stir. Add the chopped lauki (bottle gourd) and salt as required. Pour water and stir., Cover with the lid and pressure cook for about 4 to 5 whistles on a high heat., If there is lots of liquid in the sabzi, then simmer without the lid to dry the liquids., This lauki chana dal gravy has a medium consistency., When the pressure drops on its own, then only remove the lid and stir the chopped coriander leaves., You can also garnish the curry with coriander leaves. Serve lauki chana dal hot with phulkas or rotis., , , Notes, To make lauki chana dal curry in a pan, add about 1.5 cup water and cover and cook. If the water dries up whilst cooking you can add some more water., , Ensure that the lauki is fresh, tender with a mild neutral taste. If the lauki has a bitter taste then don\u2019t use it and discard it., , Instead of oil you can use ghee., , We prefer this curry to be slightly spicy. But if you can\u2019t tolerate spicy food then skip or reduce the green chilies and red chili powder., , The chana dal should be in the shelf period. Don\u2019t use rancid or aged chana dal., , The consistency of the curry is medium. But if you want to make a semi-dry or slightly thick lauki chana dal ki sabzi then add less water., , , , Nutrition Info (Approximate Values), , Nutrition Facts, , Lauki Chana Dal, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 246, , Calories from Fat 108, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 12g, 18%, Saturated Fat 1g, 6%, Polyunsaturated Fat 1g, Monounsaturated Fat 9g, Sodium, 676mg, 29%, Potassium, 550mg, 16%, Carbohydrates, 31g, 10%, Fiber 9g, 38%, Sugar 7g, 8%, Protein, 6g, 12%, , , Vitamin A, 1120IU, 22%, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), 1mg, 67%, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), 1mg, 59%, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), 1mg, 5%, Vitamin B6, 1mg, 50%, Vitamin C, 24mg, 29%, Vitamin E, 5mg, 33%, Vitamin K, 11\u00b5g, 10%, Calcium, 115mg, 12%, Vitamin B9 (Folate), 29\u00b5g, 7%, Iron, 3mg, 17%, Magnesium, 69mg, 17%, Phosphorus, 68mg, 7%, Zinc, 1mg, 7%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , This Lauki Chana Dal post is from the archives (December 2013) and has been republished and updated on 11 September 2021., , Share This Recipe:, WhatsApp, Facebook, Pin, Tweet, Email, Share, 1.4k, Meet Dassana, Welcome to Dassana's Veg Recipes.

The chana dal really added taste to the curry, Because of the huge size of my vegetable, I had to scale up your quantities of spices and onion.  In the US, the tomatoes have no taste, are bland (!) and so I added a little citric acid crystals, and a few drops of lime juice for flavor., I also used a little coconut oil and a few drops of mustard oil for added flavor., , On the matter of the adulteration of coriander powder and other powdered spices like red chilli powder etc., \u2026 that is not a concern in the USA because the profits are already so high, and the laws are so strict and the penalties are so severe that nobody would dare do that.  In 1992, an indian importer tried to import uncleaned Basmati Rice, by the ship load, via a port in New York, and the resulting action taken by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) caused him to go bakrupt., , Best wishes for the continued success of your web site and Apps   !!@!!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Oct 29, 2017 at 7:47 pm, , , , , chana dal in this recipe does add a lot of texture and flavor. variaitons are always possible in most recipe and of course some lemon juice or citric acid can be added to get a tang in the curry. in indian adulteration is still there and one has to be careful when buying ready made spice mixes. in fact even milk is adulterated. its good that the laws in US are so strict. i wish we had such laws in india too. thanks for the best wishes., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Sowmya, , says:, , , , Oct 22, 2017 at 8:01 pm, , , , , Mouth watering, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Oct 22, 2017 at 8:30 pm, , , , , Thanks Sowmya, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Iram fatma, , says:, , , , Sep 19, 2017 at 3:51 pm, , , , , After searching several of a good veg app, my search stop here, every recipe turns out great, d way u describe everything wid detail, wid photos everything is vry helpful, In love wid diz app :*, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Sep 19, 2017 at 8:13 pm, , , , , thanks a lot iram. nice to know that the app is helping you. we do plan to make the app more user friendly in the future., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Nithya, , says:, , , , Jan 09, 2017 at 5:27 am, , , , , You are just awesome.

Is it possible to give the weight of the vegetables as well as in cup quantity?.Also can you give the weight of 1 inch of ginger as well as in spoon measurement. .This of course is a problem in most recipes. In India these vegetables are not sold by size. Apart from this problem you recipes  are easy to follow and  turn out well. I guess the sizes of the vegetables and the recipe turns out okay but I am sure if I knew the weights I could do a better job., , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Oct 29, 2015 at 7:27 pm, , , , , hi sunita, firstly thanks. regarding the suggestion, i have already started giving the measurements in both cup quantities and weight from the last 1 year. since this quite an old recipe, i have not updated this one. for ginger also i have begun given the amount in tsp. generally we use ginger measurement in size, as most people do have a visual idea of how much 1/2 or 1 inch ginger is. i know that size can be a problem especially for onions and tomatoes. a few readers had suggested me to give the weight as well as cup measurement and i give them now., , , Reply, , , , , , , See More Comments, , , Meet Dassana, Hi, I am Dassana.
