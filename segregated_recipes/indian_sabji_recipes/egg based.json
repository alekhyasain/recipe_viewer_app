        "Egg Kadhai Sabji": "Ingredients: , , 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, , 1 to 2 Kashmiri deseeded dried red chilies (leave out for kids), , 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, , 2 to 3 green cardamoms, , 2 cloves, , \u00bc inch very small piece of cinnamon (if you add more you will ruin the dish), , , If your spices are soft due to weather conditions, you may toast them first in a pan until crunchy, cool and grind them. I use the spices form the refrigerator so they are crisp., , , , 3. Grind to a fine powder. Kadai masala is usually ground to a coarse powder. But if you leave it too coarse you may get the grits in the gravy. So make sure it is fine or slightly coarse., , , , Make Onion Tomato Masala, , 4. Heat a pan with half tablespoon oil on a high flame. Saute 1 heaped cup of cubed onions along with 6 cashews until they turn transparent or lightly golden., , , , 5. Add 1\u00bd to 2 cups chopped tomatoes and continue to saute on a medium heat until tomatoes turn mushy and soft. If needed add little salt or cover and cook to fasten the cooking., , , , 6. Cool this completely., , , , 7. Add the cooled onion tomatoes to a grinder jar., , , , 8. Blend it to smooth paste without adding water., , , , Make Kadai Paneer, , 9. Add another half tablespoon of oil or ghee to the pan and heat up on a high flame. To get the restaurant style smoky flavor, use the same pan used for sauteing onion tomatoes earlier. Add capsicum and onions, saute on a high flame just until half cooked (must remain crunchy). Constantly toss to prevent burning., , , , 10. Add paneer. Make sure it is not too moist before you add. Toss it in the hot pan for 60 to 90 seconds on a medium heat. Less than 2 mins. Do not overcook else the paneer turns hard. Transfer all these to a plate., , , , 11. Add 1 tablespoon oil or ghee and heat it on a medium flame. Saute 1\u00a0teaspoon ginger & garlic paste until the raw smell goes away., , , , 12. Add the ground spices \u2013 kadai masala and saute it well on a medium to low heat. We have not toasted the spices earlier so we need to do it well here until it turns aromatic & the raw flavor goes away., , , , 13. Add onion tomato puree., , , , 14. Saute it well for about 2 mins. Add half tsp garam masala and half tsp kashmiri red chilli powder., , , , 15. Next saute well for 2 mins again. You may taste the onion tomato masala first and then add more red chili powder as needed. Since we have sauteed onions and tomatoes well in the earlier steps, we don\u2019t need to cook the masala a lot., , , , Make Kadai Paneer Gravy, , 16. Add 1\u00bd to 2 cups water and add \u00bd teaspoon salt. Mix well and bring this to a boil on a medium high heat., , , , 17. Reduce the heat and cook until the gravy turns thick and flavorful. Make sure the gravy doesn\u2019t look runny at this stage. After boiling it well, you will see traces of oil on top of the gravy. Next towards the end add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi., , , , 18. Add the sauteed onion, capsicum and paneer that we had set aside. Mix well and turn off the stove. Taste test and add more salt and garam masala if required., , , , 19. Mix well. Add ginger juliennes and chopped coriander leaves. Cover and set aside for 2 mins. Do not leave on the hot stove since it will continue to cook further. Transfer to a serving bowl., , , , Allow kadai paneer to rest for at least 15 mins so the paneer absorbs the flavors. You can also smoke the curry if you like following my, dal makhani, post., , This delicious kadai paneer gravy goes very well with roti / chapathi, , plain paratha, , , butter naan, or plain basmati rice or flavored rice like jeera rice, , ghee rice, or, Pulao, ., , , , Pro Tips, , Kadai masala:, The key to a good kadai paneer is in using the right combination of spices to make kadai masala. So use them as mentioned in the recipe. Substituting it with a regular or normal garam masala will give you a regular paneer curry. However it will still taste good but you won\u2019t find any kadai flavors in it., , Dry roasting the whole spices before grinding is optional. But if you do not have a good grinder/blender then you may roast them to crisp up. I do not roast them as I keep all my spices in the fridge and they remain crisp., , Dried red chilies, are used in this recipe as they impart a smoky flavour to the dish. Using good quality dried red chilies that are not too spicy or pungent is very important. I usually use Kashmiri or byadgi red chilies. Otherwise the dish may turn very spicy with bitter tones. You can also reduce the amount of red chilies and use red chilli powder., , Ginger:, Adding ginger julienne towards the end of cooking infuses a great aroma to the dish. Do not skip this., , Paneer:, Using good quality fresh paneer makes a lot of difference to the dish. If you prefer to make your own paneer at home, you can follow this post on, How to make paneer, . If using store bought paneer then immerse it in slightly hot water for 15 mins. Drain completely and use it., , How to make best kadai paneer, , Always saute the powdered kadai masala in oil until it turns fragrant. This is the key to an aromatic kadai paneer., , Smoky flavour: Kadai paneer served in some restaurants get a mild smoky flavor as the bell peppers & onions are tossed on a high flame on large burners., , To get similar flavors toss the veggies on the highest flame as mentioned in the recipe. This lends a mild smoky aroma to the dish., , Substitutions:, , , You can use any store bought kadai masala., , For a creamy version you can also use a few tablespoons of cream towards the end., , You can easily substitute tofu for paneer in the recipe., , If you do not eat onions and garlic, you may skip both of them completely. Without onions the dish will be on the tangy side. So to balance that you may need to add some cream at the last stage. Without onions, the quantity of the prepared kadai paneer will be lesser., , For the gravy version, I have used cashews. You may substitute them with blanched almonds., , , , Photo Guide, , Recipe 2 \u2013 Kadai Paneer Semi Dry, , Semi dry kadai paneer is the most common one served in restaurants. This is easier to make than the first recipe as it needs only saut\u00e9ing the basic masala with ground kadai masala. Then bell peppers are saut\u00e9ed and lastly paneer is added to it. This goes well with rotis and can also be used to make roti rolls., , , , Unlike the first gravy version, , To make this creamy, pour, , , 200 grams (1 \u00bd cup paneer cubed), \u00bd cup onions finely chopped (optional), 1\u00bd cup tomatoes finely chopped or pureed (300 to 325 grams), \u00be cup cubed capsicums (green or red or both), 1\u00bd teaspoon ginger garlic paste or only ginger paste, 1/8 tsp ground turmeric, 2 tablespoons oil (or 1 tbsp oil + 1 tbsp butter), \u00bd to 1 teaspoon red chilli powder (adjust to taste), \u00bd to \u00be teaspoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon kasuri methi, \u00be teaspoon salt (adjust to taste), \u00bc cup heavy cream or whipping cream (optional), 2 tbsps coriander leaves chopped for garnish, \u00bd inch ginger juliennes, , For the kadai masala, 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, 2 to 3 kashmiri dried red chilies, \u00be teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf), 1 green cardamom, , Preparation \u2013 recipe 2, , 1. Rinse tomatoes & bell peppers. Chop tomatoes very finely. Alternately you can puree the tomatoes and use. Make a fine paste of ginger and garlic or grate them. Cube paneer and bell peppers to \u00be inch pieces. Set aside. If you want to use onion, you can fine chop 1 medium onion., , 2. Add 1 tablespoon coriander seeds and 2 to 3 dried red chilies to a pan and toast them until crisp on a low heat. When the red chilies turn crisp remove to a plate and cool them. To the same pan add \u00be teaspoon fennel seeds and roast on a medium heat until aromatic. Remove these as well to the same plate and cool them completely., , 3. Next add them to a grinder or spice blender along with 1 green cardamom., , , , 4. Make a fine powder and set aside., , , , How to make, , 5. Pour 2 tablespoons oil to the kadai and heat it. When the oil turns hot, add 1\u00bd teaspoon ginger garlic paste. Saute on a medium heat until the ginger garlic turns aromatic. Do not burn them., , , , 6. Then add 1\u00bd chopped tomatoes, 1/8 teaspoon turmeric and half teaspoon salt., , , , 7. Fry all of them until the tomatoes turn fully mushy. If needed cover and cook. Then add \u00bd\u00a0to 1 teaspoon red chilli powder and ground kadai masala., , , , 8. Mix well and fry until the masala turns aromatic and begins to release some oil on the sides. This is an indication that the masala is cooked well. This step is very important to bring out the flavors. Then add garam masala., , , , 9. Pour 4 to 5 tablespoons of water at this stage and cook the masala until it thickens. Add capsicum and saute for 2 to 3 mins until they begin to smell good., , , , 10. Then add the cubed paneer and 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi. Mix well to coat the paneer with the masala., , , , 11. Cover the pan. Cook on a very low heat for 2 to 3 mins. Cooking for too long will make the paneer harder. If you prefer to use cream pour 3 to 4 tbsps at this stage and give a good stir. Taste test and add more salt if needed., , , , 12. Sprinkle coriander leaves and mix well. Add the half inch ginger juliennes and turn off the heat., , , , Allow kadai paneer to rest in the pan covered for 10 to 20 mins so the paneer absorbs all of the flavors of kadai masala. Serve with roti, plain parathas or stuff it in your sandwich., , , , Variations for recipe 2, , Usually there is no cream or cashews added to it like it is done for most other paneer recipes. If you prefer to serve this with rice, then you can also make the below mentioned variations:, , , You can pour 3 to 4 tbsps of heavy cream to this to make it creamy. If using cream you will need to up the heat level as cream tones down the heat., , If you like it to be moderately creamy then puree the tomatoes with 8 cashews and use it here. Also you will need to pour half cup water to cook the masala. This makes a semi dry kadai paneer which will go well with roti or even with basmati rice., , To make it kids\u2019 friendly reduce the chilies or skip the chilli powder. Keep the rest of the spices as mentioned in the recipe., , , This kadai paneer recipe is roughly being adapted from chefs Nita Mehta\u2019s and Sanjeev Kapoor\u2019s cookbooks. I have made several changes to the original recipes to suit our taste buds., , Faqs, , What is in kadai paneer?, , Bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, paneer, kadai masala (coriander, red chilies, cardamoms, fennel seeds, cloves and cinnamon) go into kadai paneer., , , What is the difference between kadai paneer and shahi paneer?, , Kadai paneer is made with kadai masala, bell peppers, tomatoes, sweetish and is not spicy., , , How to reduce heat & spice in kadai paneer?, , To reduce the heat & spice, skip the red chilies completely or cut down to half the quantities in the recipe.

But after cooking the gravy for over 15 mins, I don\u2019t see any oil being released. What is happening?  Did I put too less of oil to begin with. Also my gravy is popping too much and making a mess around lol, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Viraj, , , , March 16, 2024 1:08 am, , , , , , Yes, less oil in the gravy. You should see small traces because this recipe does not use a lot of oil. But don\u2019t worry it tastes delicious. Cover the pot and cook, thick gravy often splatters., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Test, , , , , , March 3, 2024 2:24 pm, , , , , , we  don\u2019t need  jeera for Kadai masala?, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Test, , , , March 3, 2024 2:33 pm, , , , , , If you want you may add half teaspoon cumin.

I am late! Just wondering if you made the same recipe. So many freshly ground whole spices + garam masala + ginger garlic is supposed to be so flavorful. A simple way to add flavor is to add more garam masala.
