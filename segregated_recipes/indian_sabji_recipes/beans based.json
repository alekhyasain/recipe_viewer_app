        "Beans Poriyal": "Ingredients: \u25a2, 250, , grams, , green beans, , (preferably fresh and tender), \u25a2, 3 to 4, , tablespoons, , coconut, , (fresh, frozen or desiccated unsweetened), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , chilli powder, , or  \u00be tsp sambar powder or 1 green chilli, \u25a2, 1 to 1\u00bd, , tablespoon, , oil, \u25a2, \u00bc, , teaspoon, , mustard seeds, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , urad dal, , (optional), \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , chana dal, , (optional), \u25a2, \u215b, , teaspoon, , hing, , (asafoetida) (optional), \u25a2, 1, , red chilli, , broken, \u25a2, 1, , sprig, , curry leaves, \u25a2, \u215b, , teaspoon, , turmeric, \u25a2, \u2153, , teaspoon, , salt,  Instructions: , For more vegetable stir fry recipes, you can check, Bitter gourd stir fry, Potato stir fry, Vendakkai poriyal, Carrot stir fry, Ladies finger stir fry, , , , , Photo Guide, , How to make Green Beans Poriyal (Stepwise photos), , Preparation, , 1. Nip off both the ends of the beans and remove the fibrous strings if any. For tender & young beans there will be no strings on the sides. For this recipe I have used about 250 grams., , , , 2. I usually spray some vinegar and allow them to rest for 10 mins. Then soak for another 10 mins and then wash off a few times. Drain water completely., , , , 3. Hold a handful of beans together and begin to chop them to the desired size. If beans are not tender, then it is good to chop them to small sizes. This helps them cook faster. If using young french beans then you can chop them to almost half inch long., , , , Make poriyal, , 4. Heat 1 to 1\u00bd\u00a0tablespoon oil in a pan or kadai. Add \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon mustard seeds, 1 broken red chili, 1 teaspoon urad dal and 1 teaspoon chana dal. Fry them until golden. If you do not have the lentils you may skip them but they impart a nutty aroma., , , , 5. Then add 1 pinch hing and 1 sprig curry leaves. Saute for a while until the leaves turn crisp., , , , 6. Add chopped beans, \u215b\u00a0teaspoon turmeric and \u2153\u00a0teaspoon salt. Stir fry for about 2 mins., , , , 7. Cover and cook for 2 mins on a low flame. After 2 to 3 mins, open the lid to check if it has released any moisture., , , , 8. If the beans look too dry, sprinkle some water, a few tablespoons would be good enough. If beans are fresh and tender they tend to get cooked with their own moisture, you may not need to add any water., , , , 9. When the French beans are cooked completely to tender, then add \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon red chili powder or \u00be tsp sambar powder. You can also use 1 to 2 tbsp peanut podi, flax seed podi or idli podi., , , , 10. Add fresh grated coconut or desiccated coconut., , , , 11. Stir well and saute for a minute. Switch off the stove., , , , Serve beans poriyal with rice, rasam and sambar., , , , Pro Tips, , Green Beans: Use tender, fresher and young green beans that are crisp, feel firm and easily snap. Mature beans that are harvested later won\u2019t cook faster in the pan. This is a stir fried dish so young veggies go well as we don\u2019t cook them with water in the recipe., , Coconut: Though traditionally fresh grated coconut is used. It can easily be replaced with frozen or unsweetened desiccated coconut or with copra. Though desiccated coconut won\u2019t taste the same it is just okay to use. A better substitute is to use idli podi or chutney podi., , , Related Recipes, , Kakarakaya fry | ..., , , Potato Fry (Aloo ..., , , Vendakkai Poriyal..., , , Carrot Curry, , , Ladies Finger Fry..., , , Sambar Recipe, Ho..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Beans Poriyal (Indian Green Beans Fry), , , 5, from, 62, votes, , , , Beans poriyal is a traditional South Indian dish made with green beans, spices, curry leaves and fresh coconut.

Cow\u2019s milk can cause allergies in young babies, 2. Cow\u2019s milk has good amount of vitamins etc but not enough fats., , Though doctors do not recommend any other milk other than mothers milk or formula for babies under 1 year, In india for many years babies have grown up healthy, drinking buffalo\u2019s milk. I think you should try buffalos milk and put your baby more on solids. By the end of 8 th month, you can also start early dinner like at 6.30 pm, Hope these help, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Rama, , , , , , January 28, 2017 4:02 pm, , , , , , Hi mam my baby now 6months old can i feed cows milk to her, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Popular Recipes, , Chana Masala Recipe (Chickpea Masala), Samosa Recipe (Punjabi Potato Samosa), Dosa Recipe, How to make Dosa Batter, Palak Paneer Recipe (Indian Spinach Paneer), Dal Makhani Recipe (Restaurant Style), Paneer Butter Masala Recipe, , Rajma Recipe | Rajma Masala | Rajma Chawal, , , , , , Collections, , 100+ Indian Dinner Recipes & Easy Ideas, Paneer Recipes, Rice Recipes (Variety Indian Rice Dishes), Diwali Snacks Recipes | 100 Diwali Special Recipes, Diwali Sweets Recipes | Diwali Recipes 2024, 25 Bread Recipes for Snacks & Breakfast, , , , , , Sweets, , Rava Laddu Recipe (Rava Ladoo), Moong Dal Halwa Recipe, Jalebi recipe, Rasgulla recipe, Rasmalai Recipe, Gulab Jamun Recipe, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , \u00a9 2025 Swasthi's Recipes, , Privacy policy, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Insert, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Toggle Menu Close, , , , , , , , Search for:, , , , , Search, , , , , , , , , , Rate This Recipe, , , , , , , , , Your vote:, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Name *, , , , , Email *, , , , , , Rate and Review Recipe, , , A rating is required, , A name is required, , An email is required, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Recipe Ratings without Comment, , , , , , , Something went wrong.

Of course the health factor comes into picture only when the spicy lentil paste is steamed instead of being sauteed in a generous amount oil. It is a dry curry prepared using a vegetable with a sauteed or steamed and sauteed spicy lentil paste. And I obviously prefer the latter because of the less usage of oil in the recipe. The vegetables that usually go into the dish are green beans, fresh fenugreek greens, cabbage and such., , , The legume that usually goes in the preparation of this delicious would be split chick peas (chana dal) whereas in Andhra regions, split pigeon peas (toordal), yellow lentils (moong dal) or even a combo of legumes are used. I heard the name sandiga koora for patoli for the first time from one of my husband's aunts and so, I assume that is Rayalaseema in origin and the version uses, split pigeon peas, rather than, split chick peas, ., , , (Yield 6 servings), , 3 cups finely chopped yard long beans, , 4 to 6 tbsp. toor dal / split pigeon peas / kandi pappu, , 2 tsp. cumin seeds, , 3 to 4 tbsp. shredded dry coconut / copra / endu kobbari, , 4 dried Indian variety or any spicy red chillies, , 1 tbsp. oil, , 1 tsp. chana dal / split chickpeas, , 1 tsp. urad dal / skinned, split black gram, , 1 tsp. mustard seeds, , 1 tsp. cumin seeds, , Few curry leaves, , 1/8 tsp. turmeric powder, , Salt to taste, , , , For the final letter 'Z' of the series, 'Zimikand Halwa' & 'Zucchini - Tomato Pappu' are my entries., Thank you Nupur for such a wonderful event, which I really enjoyed. You ARE a gracious hostess. :), , Zimikand Halwa, , Zucchini - Tomato Pappu, ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, Zimikand Halwa, I had a feeling that I could not pull off a dry zunka and it was planned that zucchini would come into picture only if I could not find any other 'Z' alternatives. When I was going through the hindi words for veggies, I came across 'Zimikand'. After some web surfing, I concluded that it has to be suran or ratalu, the purple yams., I must admit, I have never encountered these 'Indian Yams' in and around the region, I grew up. I therefore, went yesterday and bought two bags of frozen ratalu. The picture on the bag had beautiful purple discs of chopped ratalu. When I opened them, it was a sheer disappointment. Half of them were brown rotten things. I had to throw more than half of them into the garbage. The remaining purple things were enough to cheer me up. I would like to see some real fresh stuff in the future and enjoy it in it's true form, ., Somehow, I did not wish to see the purple hue lost to some spices and other veggies added in the dish. Unlike some colorful root vegetables, these yams were on the bland side. Still, their rich color tempted me to try a sweet dish. I thawed them for a while, grated them, added milk and sugar, cooked it and ended up with a yummy dessert. I have a hunch that probably the halwa would be rich purple in color, if I had access to the fresh stuff., Coming to this lilac colored dessert, it was just heavenly. Unlike carrots & lauki, this vegetable almost becomes a mush when cooked and will have a melt in your mouth kind of creaminess to it. If you have ratalu available at a grocery store near you, I would recommend you to try this dish. I was so glad that I did not try to cook it into one more sabji. I am so excited with this new found veggie and am looking forward to try some more desserts with it., :, Grated zimikand - 1 cup, Milk - less than 1/2 cup, Sugar - 1/2 cup, Ghee - 2 Tbsp, Cardamom powder - 1/4 tsp, Cooking part, :, Add grated zimikand, milk, sugar and ghee to a pan and cook on low flame. The mixture tends to get a little sticky at the initial stages but keep stirring in between. When the mixture turns to almost halwa consistency, add cardamom powder and mix well. Cook for a couple of minutes more and turn off the stove., Refrigerate for a couple of hours and serve., ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, Zucchini - Tomato Pappu (Dal), I could not resist the fresh zucchinis at the grocery store and brought some. I made delicious, dal adding some tomatoes along with it today., Toor dal - 1 Cup, Zucchini - Peeled, ends cut and chopped into medium sized cubes - 1 Cup, Small sized tomatoes - 2, 2 Serrano peppers (or green chillies), vertically slit into 4 pieces, Turmeric powder - 1/2 tsp, Tamarind extract - 1/4 cup, Chilli powder - 2 to 2 & 1/2 tsp, Salt -2 & 1/2 tsp, For tadka / seasoning, you need:, Oil - 1 tsp, Cumin seeds - 1 tsp, Mustard seeds - 1 tsp, A few pinches of asafoetida, Few curry leaves, Cooking pappu, :, Cook toordal with tomatoes (whole), green chillies, turmeric powder adding 2 cups of water in a pressure cooker until you hear one or two whistles., Mean while, cook the zucchini with a little amount of water in a MW. Let it be cooked till tender, (not turning them into a mush)., When the valve pressure is gone, remove the cooker's lid. Mash the tomatoes well along with the dal and add cooked zucchini, tamarind extract, chilli powder, salt to the dal mixture., Turn on the stove and let the dal simmer on low - medium flame for about five minutes., Heat oil in a small pan and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida and curry leaves in that order. When mustard seeds start to pop, turn off the stove and add the mixture to the cooked dal and mix well., Serve hot with rice and ghee or rotis., ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, Previously On A - Z series, D -, Daikon Chutney, E -, Eggplants, Stuffed, F -, French beans & Indian Beans In a Sabji, G -, Gajar Ka Kheer, H -, Hagalakayi (Bitter gourd) Gojju, I -, Idli Upma, I -, Imli Ke Paththon Ka Dal, J -, Jalapenos \u2013 Mirchi Ka Salan, K -, Kosumbari, L -, Lauki Ka Halwa, M -, Mirapakaya \u2013 Aloo Koora, N -, Nuggekayi Palya, O -, Okra dal, P -, Patoli, Q -, Quick Mango chutney, R -, Rajma - Aloo, S -, Spinach Rice, T -, Tomato Gojju, U -, Urlagadda \u2013 Menthaku Koora, V -, Vergodalas Dal, W -, Whole, White Potatoes In Spinach Gravy, X -, Xacuti Masala Rice, X -, Xacuti, Vegetarian, Y -, Yogurt With Snakegourd, Post a comment, , , , , , Posted by\nSuma Gandlur, , at, 6:10\u202fPM, , , , , , Labels:, Beans/Dals, ,, Dairy Products, ,, Milk, ,, Sugar, ,, Sweeteners, ,, Tomato, ,, Toor dal, ,, Vegetables, ,, Zimikand / Ratalu, ,, Zucchini, , , , , , , , , , , , Home, , , , , Subscribe to:, Posts (Atom), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ALL PHOTOGRAPHS AND TEXT - COPYRIGHT\u00a9 2006-2018 VEGGIE PLATTER, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Instructions: thaw them, chop them and cook them as above.
