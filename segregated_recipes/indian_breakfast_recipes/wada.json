        "Barnyard Millet Wada": "Ingredients: 3/4 cup Barnyard Millet / Bhagar / Moraiyo, 2 -3 medium size Potato boiled and peeled, Salt as per taste, 1/2 tsp jeera/cumin seeds, 2-3 green chilly finely chopped ( can increase the green chilly if you like spicy ), 1/2 inch ginger crushed, 1 tbsp dessictaed / grated coconut ( optional ), 1 tbsp finely chopped Cilantro leaves ( can also use spinach or mint leaves as per taste preference ), Avacado oil spray or 1 tbsp of any other cooking oil Instructions: Wash and cook the bhagar/millet on low flame in a pan covered with a lid. Add 2 cups water to the bhagar/millet, add salt as per taste and then cover with a lid, cook on low flame until done. Takes about 7-8 minutes. Stir once in between and also check, it can stick to the base and burn, so be extra careful., Alternatively can cook in Instant pot high pressure 4 minutes, no pressure release. Or in a pressure cooker for 1 whistle and natural pressure release., Boil the potatoes, peel and mash them nicely. Boil in a pressure cooker for 2 whistles, or in an instant pot high pressure 6-7 minutes., In a mixing bowl add in the mashed potatoes, cooked bhagar, green chilly, coconut, ginger and cilantro leaves, jeera and salt as per taste if needed, do a taste test then add, as needed. Mix all this nicely, it should form a tight dough ( not too soft, if its soft the Vadas will break and loose the shape )., Grease palms with oil, then scoop out a big spoonful of the mix and shape like a donut or a medu vada ( Roll between palms, then flatten it and make a hole in the center ), make all similarly and keep ready. If you want can just make round shaped koftas and also airfry and enjoy., Preheat the Airfryer for 5 minutes, then line the airfryer basket with a perforated parchment paper and then place the prepared Vadas on it, nicely spaced from one another for even and uniform cooking/airfrying. Spray the Vadas with avacado oil spray, but\u00a0if using oil with a brush for applying then let the Vadas cook halfway then apply oil and flip. Airfry at 375 F for 10 minutes, then increase the temperature to 400 F and set the time to 16 minutes. Flip halfway, and be very careful when flipping, if its coming off easily that means its properly cooked and hence can be flipped easily. But in case its still soggy and not taken a hold shape then don't force pick, it will dislodge the shape, in that case wait for another 2-3 minutes before flipping., Once done, look for the crispy light brownish tinged Vadas. The cook time may be plus or minus 2-3 minutes as it depends on various factors the size and thickness of the vada, total count and also type of the airfryer., Enjoy these with Coconut chutney ( As I made for Navratri fasting so I just used 3 tbsp coconut, 5 green chilly, 1/2 inch ginger, 1 tbsp cilantro leaves and 2 tbsp peanuts, salt as per taste and 1/2 tsp of jeera seeds, blend this till smooth )., If making on a regular day, no fasting day, then enjoy with your favorite chutney and sambhar., Alternatively you can also bake in a regular oven, at 425 F for about 30-35 minutes, flip halfway., And if want to deep fry, then can be deep fried too., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Powered by, , , Create your own unique website with customizable templates., , , Get Started, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Home, , , , Festival Specials, , , , Breakfast, , , , Flat Breads, , , , Indian Curries, , , , Rice Recipes, , , , Regional Dishes, , , , No Onion Garlic Recipes, , , , Soups and Salads, , , , Fusion Recipes, , , , Fasting Recipes, , , , Instant Pot Recipes, , , , Air Fryer Recipes, , , , Snacks/Appetizers, , , , Chutney/Sauce/Dips, , , , Dessert, , , , Refreshing Drinks, , , , Contact, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,"
