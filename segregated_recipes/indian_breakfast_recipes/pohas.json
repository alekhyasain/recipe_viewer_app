        "Poha": "Ingredients: raw onions or fresh coconut., , About My Poha Recipes, , The first one is the Maharashtrian Kanda batata poha recipe which we make often for our breakfast. Here Kanda translates to onions and Batata to potato in Marathi. So this one is made with onions and potatoes. You can use both or skip any one of them. Or replace potatoes with some green peas., , I prefer to use potatoes as my kids love them in their poha. You can either use boiled/ steamed potatoes or use them raw directly and cook in the pan., , coconut. This is best to serve for a snack. In this recipe poha is not rinsed or steamed. It is eaten in the raw form but is softened. It tastes delicious with good flavors of fried curry leaves and green chilies., , , This is made by mixing chopped onions, fresh grated coconut, coriander leaves, lemon juice, poha, salt and sugar. To soften the poha, little coconut water or plain water is splashed., , Then a tempering of curry leaves, green chilies, mustard seeds and peanuts is poured to the mixture. It is covered so the dadpe pohe absorbs much of the tempering flavour., , This is even easier than the first recipe. Again there are different versions of this. Sometimes I add little grated cucumber, carrots and sometimes tomatoes too. This is best made with fresh coconut and medium poha., , , , 2 cups poha (medium flakes), \u00be to 1 cup fresh grated coconut, 1 medium onion (\u00bd cup finely chopped), 1 to 2 green chilies (chopped, adjust to taste), 1/3 cup coriander leaves (fine chopped), 1 teaspoon powdered sugar (or fine sugar), \u00bd teaspoon salt (adjust to taste), 1 medium lemon (adjust to taste), 1 to 2 tablespoons coconut water or plain water, \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon mustard seeds, 1 tablespoon oil (more if needed), 2 sprigs curry leaves (torn or chopped), 1 pinch hing / asafoetida, 1 to 2 pinches turmeric, \u00bc cup peanuts, , \u25a2, 1 \u00bd, , cups, , poha, , (beaten rice flakes )(thick to medium flakes), \u25a2, 1, , medium, , onion, , finely chopped, \u25a2, 2 to 3, , green chilies, , slit or chopped, \u25a2, 1, , sprig, , curry leaves, \u25a2, 1, , medium, , potato, , (optional)  cubed to \u00bd inch (or \u00bd cup mix veggies), \u25a2, 1\u00bd, , tablespoons, , oil, \u25a2, 3 to 4, , tablespoons, , peanuts, , or cashews, \u25a2, \u00be, , teaspoon, , mustard seeds, \u25a2, \u00be, , teaspoon, , cumin seeds, , (jeera), \u25a2, 1, , pinch, , hing, , (asafoetida), \u25a2, \u00bc, , teaspoon, , turmeric, , (add more if needed for color), \u25a2, \u2153, , teaspoon, , salt, , (adjust to taste), \u25a2, \u00bd to 1, , teaspoon, , sugar, , (optional), \u25a2, Lemon juice as needed, \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , coriander leaves, , chopped,  Instructions: then it is good to use them boiled., , The second recipe is for dadpe pohe which is more common in the Konkan region. This recipe needs fresh coconut and is quick to make like the first one. I have been making this in the recent times for a change., , Another popular version is the Indori poha which I am yet to share. The use of fennel seeds make it very distinct in flavor from the Maharashtrian version. It is garnished the same way with sev & raw onions., , , More Breakfast recipes,, Chilla recipe, Methi Thepla, Upma recipe, Rava idli, Semiya upma, Akki roti, , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Poha (Stepwise Photos), , 1. Clean 1\u00bd cups poha and add them to a large colander, strainer or bowl or pot. Please note that to make non sticky poha, you will need to use thick or medium flakes. If you use thin flakes poha will turn mushy after rinsing them., , , 2. You have to be quick at this step as doing it slowly will make them too mushy and soggy. Rinse them well with clean filtered water. Drain the water completely. Repeat the rinse & drain the water completely. I usually rinse them twice but if you feel they turn too mushy after the first rinse then stop rinsing further. Keep the bowl aside., , , 3. Meanwhile chop 1 medium sized onion and 1 to 2 green chilies. Also rinse the curry leaves and coriander leaves. Fine chop the coriander leaves. If you want to use potatoes then chop them to half inch cubes and keep them immersed in water until needed., , 4. Check if poha has softened by pressing down a few flakes in between your thumb and fore finger. Run your finger across the flattened rice to break lumps if any. Poha would have absorbed water and softened in about 5 to 7 mins., , If they are not soft yet, then sprinkle some water and set aside until the tempering is ready. Make sure they do not turn mushy. Add salt and sugar (optional). Mix and set aside., , , Temper for Poha, , 5. Heat a pan with \u00bd tablespoon oil and fry the peanuts until golden and crunchy. Set them aside for garnishing. This way the peanuts remain crunchy. You can also dry roast the peanuts if you prefer., , , 6. Heat the same pan with 1 to 1 \u00bd tablespoon oil. When the oil becomes hot, add \u00be\u00a0teaspoon mustard seeds and \u00be\u00a0teaspoon cumin seeds. Let them splutter., , , 7. Add chopped onions, green chilies and curry leaves., , , 8. Saute until the onions turn pink.\u00a0If using potatoes, drain the water completely and add the cubes to the pan. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes., , , 9. Cover the pan and cook on a low heat until the potatoes are soft cooked. If needed you may add more oil., , , 10. Once the potatoes are cooked thoroughly, you can saute them on a high flame for 1 to 2 mins. Add turmeric., , , 11. Add softened poha and mix well., , , 12. Cover and steam on a low heat until poha becomes hot. Stir in between to prevent burning. If you feel your poha is too dry, then you may sprinkle some water in between. When done it should be soft and not mushy. Sprinkle coriander leaves and roasted peanuts., , , 13. Take it off the heat. Taste and add more salt if needed. Add lemon juice and keep it covered until served., , , Garnish kanda batata poha with fine chopped coriander leaves and roasted peanuts. You can also sprinkle some grated coconut or crunchy sev., , , Pro Tips, , Choosing poha, : Using the right kind of poha is very important for this recipe. Always choose medium to thick poha flakes and avoid the thin ones. The thin kind are not suitable to make this recipe as they turn mushy when rinsed., , Test your poha if you are a newbie: You can check simply by rinsing a spoonful of poha in little water and drain completely. If they do not turn mushy then they are very much suitable to use in this recipe., , If they turn mushy then you may use them to make dadpe pohe (recipe 2) instead., , Rinsing poha, : Do not over rinse or over soak the poha otherwise they may turn mushy. I generally rinse them twice and drain the water completely. Cover and set aside until the tempering is ready., , After chopping the onions, check if the poha is soft by pressing a few flakes in between the thumb and the fore finger. They should break easily. If not then sprinkle some water. Mix and cover it till needed., , Veggies, :\u00a0To make it healthier and balanced you may add different kinds of fine chopped veggies like carrots, peas & capsicum. You can also skip the onions and use fine chopped cabbage. Blanch the cabbage in hot water for 2 to 3 mins and then add use them the same way like onions. Use whatever vegetables you like in your poha., , Toppings, : Poha is generally topped with fresh grated coconut, crunchy peanuts, sev or farsan. It tastes pretty much delicious even with peanuts alone., , Make ahead, , You can make this poha recipe ahead by simply preparing the tempering first. Cool, cover and keep the whole pan/pot in the fridge. When you are ready to eat your poha, simply rinse your flattened rice and soften them. Add them to the tempering and mix. Steam them on a low heat. Your poha will be ready in no time., , , Photo Guide, , Recipe 2, , How to Make Dadpe Pohe, , , 1. To begin with I sieve the poha so any fine powdery stuff can be easily separated. Then add them to a large plate. You will be making the dadpe poha in this., , , 2. Add onions, grated coconut, salt, powdered or fine sugar, lemon juice and coriander leaves., , , 3. Mix all of them. You will see the poha is still dry. At this stage splash little coconut water or plain water if needed. Traditionally it is made with coconut water but plain water can be used. Give a good mix. Cover this and set aside until soft. If you think it is too dry sprinkle little more water. But take care not to add a lot else it will turn mushy., , , 4. Taste test. Add more salt, sugar and lemon juice if needed. This is how mine looked after it softened. Cover this until soft for 5 to 10 mins. Onions and fresh coconut release some moisture so sprinkle more water only if needed after 10 minutes., , , How to make, , 5. Pour 1\u00bd tablespoon oil to a pan and heat it. When the oil becomes hot, add mustard seeds, chopped green chilies and torn curry leaves. When the curry leaves turn crisp, turn off. Add 1/8 teaspoon hing and a pinch of turmeric (optional)., , , 6. Pour this to the premixed poha. Cover it immediately so the flavors are absorbed., , , 7. Meanwhile, roast the peanuts in the same pan until golden and crunchy. I do not prefer to do it with the tempering as the peanuts soften a bit when covered. Add these just before serving., , , Let the dadpe pohe soften to your liking. We like ours a bit chewy and not too soft. If it is not soft then you may sprinkle little water or coconut water. Then transfer to serving bowls. Top with roasted peanuts., , , Faqs, , Why is my poha mushy?, , Using thin flattened rice flakes, over rinsing or over soaking them will make your poha mushy., , , Why is my poha hard?, , Thicker flakes won\u2019t soften quickly evenly after rinsing them a few times. Rehydrate them with a splash of water and let them rest until needed., , , Is poha healthy?, , Yes poha is healthy as it is made by minimally processing paddy. To make flattened rice flakes, paddy is soaked, parboiled and then pressed to flatten & separate the husk. Since they are processed with the bran, most of the nutrients are said to be intact., , , Is flattened rice gluten free?, , Yes flattened rice flakes are naturally gluten free. To make the dish gluten-free, skip asafoetida in the recipe or use one that is gluten-free., , , , Troubleshooting tips, , These tips are helpful especially to those living outside India. There are different kinds of poha in the market. Not all are same and many times they are not the same even though they are from the same brand. Often we end up buying whatever is available. These troubleshooting tips will come handy in such times., , Some kinds of poha are too hard, too thick and dense. They remain hard even after rinsing several times under running water. They either need a short soak for 5 to 10 minutes or they need to be steamed properly for few minutes in a steamer or cooker., , I steam the hard brown poha for 3 minutes & hard white ones for 1 minute in my cooker. They come out fluffy & perfect without becoming mushy., , Sometimes poha turns completely mushy though they look like the medium thick flakes. Test a spoonful of flattened rice by rinsing first. If they are mushy, then are no good to be rinsed. Sprinkle water little by little and mix until all of the poha becomes damp. Set aside to soak & soften., , , Related Recipes, , Upma Recipe, , , Besan Chilla Reci..., , , Thepla Recipe, , , Rava Dosa Recipe ..., , , Aloo Paratha Reci..., , , Rava Uttapam (Soo..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Poha Recipe, , , 5, from, 285, votes, , , , Poha is a simple Indian breakfast & snack made with flattened rice, peanuts & spices.

Avoid thin flakes. Add them to a bowl or a strainer or colander., \u25a2, Pour 4 to 5 cups of water and rinse them quickly. Drain the water completely. I rinse them twice., \u25a2, Cover and set aside to soften.

You may optionally add 1 to 2 tbsps of coconut water or plain water to soften them little more., \u25a2, Cover and set aside for 5 minutes until they soften. Onions and coconut will release some moisture and make the dadpe pohe soft., \u25a2, After 5 minutes, pour 1 tablespoon oil to a small tadka pan and heat it., \u25a2, Add \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon mustard seeds, 2 sprigs of torn curry leaves, 1 to 2 chopped green chilies.

Yes egg in poha is an unheard thing. But I have done it a lot of times. During the lockdown we literally ate poha everyday and had to make different every time. Scramble the eggs first, spice it with salt and ground spices. Set aside. Stir into the hot steaming poha at the end. I\u2019m sure you will love that., \ud83d\ude42, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Melanie, , , , , , Reply to, swasthi, , , , April 10, 2023 3:19 am, , , , , , Thanks.

Actually Maharashtrian poha does not use tomatoes so I have not used it here. If you want you can add a small to medium tomato to the tempering after sauteing the onions. Cover and cook till they become very soft. Later saute for a few minutes till the raw smell of tomatoes is gone. If you want for a change you can also add some pav bhaji masala and cook the onion tomatoes with little water. Then add the softened poha. Sky is the limit. You can actually make it in so many ways.

        "Kanda Poha": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make kanda poha with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , , poha recipe 2 ways | kanda poha | aloo poha | maharastrian style kanda pohe recipe, with step by step photo and video recipe. morning breakfast is perhaps one of the challenging meals to plan and prepare. it is due to the limited time availability, yet we need something special, easy and also supply all the nutrients for the daily first meal. this generally requires a lot of planning, but there are some other recipes like kanda poha or aloo pohe that are easy and healthy morning meals., , i am a huge fan of simple and easy breakfast recipes. there are many favourite easy breakfast recipes and out of those, kanda pohe, and, aloo pohe, are two of my favourite recipes. even though i hail from udupi, but i developed the taste for it while i was briefly living in hubli, north karnataka. in hubli there are so many different ways of, poha avalakk, i is served for morning breakfast, but the onion, oggarne avalakki, also known as kanda pohe was my personal favourite. it was served with fresh coriander and coconut with fresh farsan or mixture topped with it. while the pohe in maharastra is slightly different and i have shared the authentic maharastrian version. particularly i have skipped the fresh coconut toppings which can be added if you wish to. also in the aloo version, i have added tomatoes which makes it an ideal combo with sour and spicy taste in it. you may choose either one of them or combine both to make an ideal breakfast meal., , , , , , , in addition to it, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the, poha recipe 2 ways, . firstly, the pohe recipe is typically prepared with thick or medium-sized poha. the thickness of the poha is directly proportional to the soaking time. you may have to increase or decrease based on the thickness. secondly, i generally do not prefer any farsan or mixture toppings, but it is essential for many. you may choose any simple aloo bhujia, bombay mixture or any type of farsan snacks as per your taste buds. lastly, the traditional version is always prepared in an iron, wok, that helps to provide additional flavour. but it may require additional oil, so a non-stick pan is an ideal option to prepare any type of poha variants., , finally, i request you to check my other related, breakfast recipes collection, with this post of, kanda poha, recipe. it includes my other related recipes like, granola bar, , , instant set dosa, , , green papaya roti, , , mtr masala dosa, , , bottle gourd dosa, , , suji ki khandvi, , , stuffed dosa, , , masala dosa, , , aate ka nasta, , , coconut dosa, . further to these i would also like to add some more additional recipe categories
