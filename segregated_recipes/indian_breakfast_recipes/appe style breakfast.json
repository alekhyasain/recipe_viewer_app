Traditional South Indian breakfast recipes are always a popular choice across Indian states. These are healthy and tasty but typically require a lot of planning, soaking, and fermenting the dough to get the desired texture and crunchiness. However, there are many instant recipes corresponding to these traditional recipes and one such popular recipe is the instant sooji appe or rava paniyaram recipe., , I have posted quite a few South Indian instant breakfast recipes, but this recipe of rava appe has to be the closest to its counterpart if not better. Basically, which hold their shape even if it is rested. Also due to the fact that rava and yogurt are used to prepare it, it would make it even more interesting than the traditional alternative. Do try this and let me know if you like this instant recipe., , , , , Furthermore, some more related and additional tips, suggestions, and variants to the, rava paniyaram recipe, . Firstly, I have used the normal upma rava or also known as Bombay rava which is an ideal choice for this recipe. Yet you may choose other types of rava too and the other best option is fine rava for the best texture and shape. Secondly, I would heavily recommend using a nonstick pan to cook these appe compared to the cast iron pan. Cast iron pans can take more energy and oil to cook and thus making them not so effective. Lastly, I added baking soda to hasten the fermentation process. Particularly, when mixed with sour yogurt it helps to ferment it more. You may use other options like eno fruit, salt, and even yeast for the same purpose., , Finally, I request you to check my other related, Breakfast Recipes Collection, with this post on, rava paniyaram recipe, .

The traditional appe batter is prepared with rice and urad dal batter which is initially used for dosa or idli and later on the 3rd or 4th day, it is used for appe. However, this recipe of instant sooji appe or rava paniyaram is made with semolina and yogurt with baking soda for hasting the fermentation process., , Like any other traditional South Indian breakfast recipe, even this suji ke appe taste\u2019s great when served with spicy chutney. The best choice of chutney recipes for this breakfast snack is simple, coconut chutney, or even red, tomato chutney, . These can also be consumed with spicy chutney powder too.

        "Gutta Ponganalu": "Ingredients: coriander leaves and green chilies are added to flavor the batter. Optionally the batter is tempered with whole spices like mustard, cumin, hing, ginger, coconut and curry leaves to infuse the South Indian flavors., , This spiced fermented batter is poured to the cavities of the special pan \u2013 paniyaram pan. These are cooked to perfection until golden, crisp and aromatic. The resulting paniyram are soft and fluffy inside yet crisp and crusty outside., , Traditionally paniyaram were cooked in pans made of cast iron or another heavy metal, capable of cooking the batter perfectly., , Ponganalu made in this kind of pans not only cook the batter well from inside but also impart their characteristic golden color with a roasted flavor. Now-a-days non-stick pans are also preferred by a lot of people as they are lighter and easier to manage than the traditional pans., , Easier way to make Paniyaram, , South Indians make a lot of, Idli, and, Dosa, at home and it is their staple breakfast. Most of us make these paniyaram with the leftover idli and dosa batter stored in the refrigerator. So making paniyaram is easier if you have the premade homemade or store bought idli dosa batter., , In this post I share the easy way to make paniyaram with left over idli dosa batter. However if you are a large family and want to make a lot of paniyaram, I suggest you make a batch of this batter exclusively for paniyaram., , Though left over batter is a great way to use up in this recipe, the taste and texture of these would depend on the ratio of urad dal to rice in the batter. This ratio actually determines the taste, flavor and texture of your paniyaram., , A lot of experienced cooks stick to a 1:2 ratio and this is what makes the traditional ones fluffy from inside and crisp from outside, , Most of the times my Mom made these with the left over, about to go sour batter because her idli and dosa batter were made with the same ratio of 1:2 ratio. In a pinch you can make these with any ratios but makes a difference to the taste., , You can find the, sweet paniyaram here, and, Instant sweet paniyaram here, ., , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Paniyaram (Stepwise photos), , Preparation, , 1. Seasoning adds flavor to the paniyaram and they keep fresh for few hours. If you are not going to eat them right away I suggest this step. You can skip this and the next step if it is for immediate consumption., , Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan on a medium heat. Add \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon mustard seeds and wait until they crackle. Add 1 sprig chopped curry leaves., , , 2. Add half cup onions, 1 to 2 chopped green chiliesand 2 tablespoons shredded carrot (optional). Saute until the raw smell of onions has gone & they turn pink. Stir in 1 tsp grated ginger (optional.) Switch off. Add a pinch of hing and 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (optional). Let this cool slightly., , , 3. Take 1\u00bd to 2 cups thick idli / dosa batter in a bowl. \u00a0I used this, sada dosa batter, . If you are following 1:2, idli recipe, from this blog, you can add 1 to 2 tbsp rice flour per cup of fermented batter. Mix well. Do not use very runny batter as paniyaram won\u2019t turn crispy., , , 4. Add the cooled seasoning along with very little salt if needed. Stir it well. The consistency must be thick batter, not very thick or runny. If needed you may sprinkle little water and stir., , , Cooking Paniyaram, , Tip: Keep your kitchen well ventilated during this step. To season, heat the paniyaram pan well until hot. Add few drops of oil in each cavity and spread the oil well with a cloth or kitchen tissue. Be careful as the pan is hot. You can also tie a cloth to a spoon and apply the oil with ease. After spreading, turn on the stove and heat the until it begins to smoke well. Turn off the heat. Wipe off any excess oil. It is ready to use now., , 5. Heat the paniyaram pan with few drops of oil in each mold. If using a cast iron pan, you will have to season it either the previous night or in the morning. If using non stick pan, just grease it and then use., , , 6. When the pan is hot enough, fill each mold to 3/4. They will puff and raise., , , 7. Lower the heat. Partially cover and cook for 1 to 2 mins. I do this to ensure they cook well inside. You can also skip this. I also make sure to cook for a while after the lid is open to get a crust., , , 8. When they are fried to golden, turn them to the other side using a wooden spoon or a chop stick., , , 9. Cook on the other side until done, golden and crisp. Remove them to a plate. To make the next batch, reduce the heat and pour few drops of oil into the cavity. Then pour the batter., , , Serve paniyaram with, chutney, . The color of the paniyaram may vary based on the proportions of rice and dal used for making the batter and also on the kind of pan used., , , Chef\u2019s Paniyaram Recipe, , I also have a paniyaram recipe from Chef Jayalakshmi Rajkumar, who works in Taj Savoy, Ooty. When I tasted these soft, fluffy and delicious paniyaram made by her, I had to ask for the recipe., , She was generous enough to share her recipe. If you prefer to make the batter from scratch then this may be useful., , 1/4 cup urad dal, 1 cup rice, 1 cup beaten rice or poha, pinch of methi seeds., , \u25a2, 1\u00bd, , cups, , idli batter, , thick or dosa batter, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , onion, , finely chopped (1 small, \u00bc cup if using directly), \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , carrot, , grated (optional), \u25a2, 2, , green chilies, , chopped (skip for kids), \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , grated ginger, \u25a2, 6, , curry leaves, , torn or fine chopped, \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , coriander leaves, , fine chopped (optional), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , mustard seeds, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , oil, , for seasoning, \u25a2, 1, , pinch, , hing, , (optional), \u25a2, 2 to 3, , tablespoons, , oil, , as needed for the frying, \u25a2, salt, , if needed, , \u25a2, Heat a pan with oil and add mustard seeds. When they crackle, add curry leaves. Saute for a min., \u25a2, Add onions, chilies and carrots. Saute until the onions turn pink or raw smell disappears. Add ginger and saute for a minute., \u25a2, Then add coriander leaves and hing. Cool this and add to the batter., Make Kuzhi Paniyaram, \u25a2, Taste the batter and add more salt if needed. Batter must be of medium consistency not very thin or thick. If needed sprinkle some water., \u25a2, Season the paniyaram pan and heat it with few drops of oil in each cavity.  (Check notes to season your cast iron pan), \u25a2, When the pan is hot enough, pour batter up to \u00be in each mold. Lower the heat and cook for 2 mins. If desired you can cover and cook., \u25a2, When the base is golden fried, remove the lid and fry for another minute,. Turn them and cook until golden on the other side too. I usually check by poking a paniyaram with a fork or skewer to check if it is done inside., \u25a2, Remove them to a plate. To make the next batch, reduce the heat and pour few drops of oil in each cavity. Pour the batter and cook the same way., \u25a2, Serve masala paniyaram with chutney or sambar., , , Notes, , To Season your paniyaram pan, heat the pan first until very hot. Reduce the heat, pour few drops of oil in each cavity and spread it well with a kitchen tissue or cloth. Easier way is to tie a cloth over a chop stick or a spoon and use it to spread oil. Increase the heat and let the pan become smoking hot. Turn off the stove. When the temperature comes down, wipe off the excess oil. I prefer to do this after every use so it is ready for the next use. Please ventilate your kitchen well before doing this., , The pan has to be hot and not smoking hot. It has to be hot enough otherwise the paniyaram will stick to the pan and won\u2019t be able to remove them. So do not pour the batter before the pan is hot., , If the batter is too thick, your paniyaram will come out dense. If the batter is runny they will come out soft. Over fermented batter sometimes won\u2019t cook well. So whisk it well with a fork before using to make it less lighter., , , , , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Paniyaram Recipe | Kuzhi Paniyaram | Gunta Ponganalu, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 257, , Calories from Fat 9, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 1g, 2%, Sodium, 28mg, 1%, Potassium, 13mg, 0%, Carbohydrates, 41g, 14%, Fiber 16g, 67%, Protein, 19g, 38%, , , Vitamin A, 210IU, 4%, Vitamin C, 12.7mg, 15%, Calcium, 51mg, 5%, Iron, 6.1mg, 34%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , Paniyaram Recipe first published in April 2016.

I have a non-stick paniyaram pan from prestige omega select (double handle). Used it just for 3 to 4 months, while I was in Bangalore a few months ago. It was good. You have to check carefully for scratches if you order online. Also look into the reviews on amazon. I read the glass lid shatters so bought a separate steel lid. Iwachu products are available in India but not sure if they are online. I also wanted to let you know about the ovens which you asked earlier. Look for a Glen oven (not a toaster), their 65 lt is best.

The batter has to rise like dosa batter. You can check the details on fermentation process here, on my, dosa post, . Towards the end of the recipe card, I also have a video showing the batter consistency \u2013 after blending, fermenting and diluting with water.

No problem. Scrub and clean up the pan well. Heat the pan until it turns hot. Turn off the stove and smear some oil with a cloth on the hot pan. Place it back on the stove and heat it on a medium heat until it begins to emit smoke. Keep your kitchen well ventilated during this time. Let it cool down. Repeat this thrice before you start making the paddu. Sometimes even after doing this it won\u2019t become fully non-stick. Just do this again a few times. But make sure you don\u2019t use any detergent for cleaning and also don\u2019t season the pan when it is cold.

Only when they are golden brown in colour, you turn them around. Also, you can cover with a lid and cook them. You have to fill the cavities completely with the batter., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Follow US, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Recipe Categories, , , , , , , , , , By Healthy Indian

OR follow our, recipe to make idli batter, . For Idli batter, , , we need 1/2 cup\u00a0urad dal (split black lentils),\u00a01 tbsp\u00a0fenugreek (methi) seeds,\u00a02 cups\u00a0par-boiled rice (ukda chawal),\u00a03 tbsp\u00a0thick beaten rice (jada poha) and\u00a0salt\u00a0to taste., , , , , , Put the urad dal in a bowl. Fresh urad dal is best suitable to get soft idlis. Current years harvested urad dal will be white in colour without pale yellow shades. So, make use of new urad dal for better fermentation and soft idly., , , , , , Add fenugreek seeds. It helps in fermentation and make soft idlis in case you do not find current years harvested urad dal., , , , , , Wash it well., , , , , , Drain it., , , , , , Pour enough water and mix well., , , , , , Cover with a lid and keep aside to soak for 4 hours., , , , , , Drain it once it is soaked., , , , , , In another bowl, add par-boiled rice. For the homemade idli batter, we would highly recommend you make use of par-boiled rice which is a variety of short grained rice. Any variety of short or medium grained like sonna masoori, ponni rice works well. We wouldn\u2019t suggest you to make use of long-grained rice like basmati., , , , , , Pour enough water and mix well., , , , , , Add thick beaten rice., , , , , , Cover with a lid and keep aside to soak for 4 hours., , , , , , After 4 hours, drain the soaked parboiled rice and beaten rice. It will look like this., , , , , , Transfer the soaked and drained urad dal and fenugreek seeds to a mixer jar., , , , , , Add approx. 1 cup of water. Do not add all water at once, start with lesser amount and add water as needed. Traditionally, a stone grinder is used to prepare idli/dosa batter. If you have one, make use of it or you can also make use of a wet grinder or mixer grinder like us. Ensure the batter does not warm up while grinding. If your mixer jar gets heated quickly, make use of cold water while grinding. This will prevent the idly from turning hard., , , , , , Blend to a smooth paste, transfer the mixture into a deep bowl and keep aside. A light fluffy batter is a key to soft, pillowy idlis., , , , , , Similarly, drain the par-boiled rice and thick rice flakes. Poha is optional but, it helps in giving a spongy texture to, South-Indian idli, ., , , , , , Transfer to a mixer jar and add approx. 1\u00bd cup of water. Add enough water to grind the batter and don\u2019t be scared of the amount because less water results in denser idli. Also, the quantity of water depends upon the quality of rice you use., , , , , , Blend to a slightly coarse paste and add this mixture to the urad dal-fenugreek seeds mixture. Open the mixer jar once in between, push down the contents and blitz it. For the idli to have a fluffy texture, it is important to soak and blend the dal and rice separately., , , , , , Add salt. There are conflicting thoughts about the addition of salt. Many people add before fermentation, many after. But, as per our observation the addition of salt helps in fermentation. Also, regular salt contains iodine which might interfere with the fermentation process so, many people use a non-iodized salt (rock salt or sea salt)., , , , , , Mix very well with clean hands. Mixing with hands helps in the fermentation process so don\u2019t skip this step., , , , , , Cover it with a lid and keep aside to ferment in a warm place for 12 hours. Idli batter requires a warm place to ferment. If you live in a warm place, you can leave the batter outside on your kitchen counter and it will ferment. However, if you live in a cold place, place the batter in the oven with the lights on or in a preheated oven. Depending upon the weather, the batter will require somewhere between 8-12 hours to ferment., , , , , , After fermentation, the idli batter will resemble this. The batter will increase in volume and have a bubbly frothy layer on top. There will also be a typical faint sour aroma from the fermented idli batter., , , , , , Mix the batter well once again. The batter should have a nice flowing consistency. It should neither be too thick or too runny. Now our idli batter is ready to prepare idli. If not using the entire batter immediately, refrigerate in an air-tight glassware. Storing the idli batter in plastic or steel container, might make the batter sour. You can even make crisp dosa and fluffy uttapam with the same batter!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , batter for instant vegetable appe, , , , , , , , , , In a deep bowl put 2\u00a0cups readymade, idli batter, ., , , , , , Add 4\u00a0tbsp\u00a0finely, chopped spinach (palak), ., , , , , , , , Add 4\u00a0tbsp, grated cabbage, ., , , , , , Add 4\u00a0tbsp, grated carrot, ., , , , , , Add, 1\u00a0tsp, slit green chillies, paste., , , , , , Add salt to taste.

        "Gunta Ponganalu": "Ingredients: coriander leaves and green chilies are added to flavor the batter. Optionally the batter is tempered with whole spices like mustard, cumin, hing, ginger, coconut and curry leaves to infuse the South Indian flavors., , This spiced fermented batter is poured to the cavities of the special pan \u2013 paniyaram pan. These are cooked to perfection until golden, crisp and aromatic. The resulting paniyram are soft and fluffy inside yet crisp and crusty outside., , Traditionally paniyaram were cooked in pans made of cast iron or another heavy metal, capable of cooking the batter perfectly., , Ponganalu made in this kind of pans not only cook the batter well from inside but also impart their characteristic golden color with a roasted flavor. Now-a-days non-stick pans are also preferred by a lot of people as they are lighter and easier to manage than the traditional pans., , Easier way to make Paniyaram, , South Indians make a lot of, Idli, and, Dosa, at home and it is their staple breakfast. Most of us make these paniyaram with the leftover idli and dosa batter stored in the refrigerator. So making paniyaram is easier if you have the premade homemade or store bought idli dosa batter., , In this post I share the easy way to make paniyaram with left over idli dosa batter. However if you are a large family and want to make a lot of paniyaram, I suggest you make a batch of this batter exclusively for paniyaram., , Though left over batter is a great way to use up in this recipe, the taste and texture of these would depend on the ratio of urad dal to rice in the batter. This ratio actually determines the taste, flavor and texture of your paniyaram., , A lot of experienced cooks stick to a 1:2 ratio and this is what makes the traditional ones fluffy from inside and crisp from outside, , Most of the times my Mom made these with the left over, about to go sour batter because her idli and dosa batter were made with the same ratio of 1:2 ratio. In a pinch you can make these with any ratios but makes a difference to the taste., , You can find the, sweet paniyaram here, and, Instant sweet paniyaram here, ., , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Paniyaram (Stepwise photos), , Preparation, , 1. Seasoning adds flavor to the paniyaram and they keep fresh for few hours. If you are not going to eat them right away I suggest this step. You can skip this and the next step if it is for immediate consumption., , Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan on a medium heat. Add \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon mustard seeds and wait until they crackle. Add 1 sprig chopped curry leaves., , , 2. Add half cup onions, 1 to 2 chopped green chiliesand 2 tablespoons shredded carrot (optional). Saute until the raw smell of onions has gone & they turn pink. Stir in 1 tsp grated ginger (optional.) Switch off. Add a pinch of hing and 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (optional). Let this cool slightly., , , 3. Take 1\u00bd to 2 cups thick idli / dosa batter in a bowl. \u00a0I used this, sada dosa batter, . If you are following 1:2, idli recipe, from this blog, you can add 1 to 2 tbsp rice flour per cup of fermented batter. Mix well. Do not use very runny batter as paniyaram won\u2019t turn crispy., , , 4. Add the cooled seasoning along with very little salt if needed. Stir it well. The consistency must be thick batter, not very thick or runny. If needed you may sprinkle little water and stir., , , Cooking Paniyaram, , Tip: Keep your kitchen well ventilated during this step. To season, heat the paniyaram pan well until hot. Add few drops of oil in each cavity and spread the oil well with a cloth or kitchen tissue. Be careful as the pan is hot. You can also tie a cloth to a spoon and apply the oil with ease. After spreading, turn on the stove and heat the until it begins to smoke well. Turn off the heat. Wipe off any excess oil. It is ready to use now., , 5. Heat the paniyaram pan with few drops of oil in each mold. If using a cast iron pan, you will have to season it either the previous night or in the morning. If using non stick pan, just grease it and then use., , , 6. When the pan is hot enough, fill each mold to 3/4. They will puff and raise., , , 7. Lower the heat. Partially cover and cook for 1 to 2 mins. I do this to ensure they cook well inside. You can also skip this. I also make sure to cook for a while after the lid is open to get a crust., , , 8. When they are fried to golden, turn them to the other side using a wooden spoon or a chop stick., , , 9. Cook on the other side until done, golden and crisp. Remove them to a plate. To make the next batch, reduce the heat and pour few drops of oil into the cavity. Then pour the batter., , , Serve paniyaram with, chutney, . The color of the paniyaram may vary based on the proportions of rice and dal used for making the batter and also on the kind of pan used., , , Chef\u2019s Paniyaram Recipe, , I also have a paniyaram recipe from Chef Jayalakshmi Rajkumar, who works in Taj Savoy, Ooty. When I tasted these soft, fluffy and delicious paniyaram made by her, I had to ask for the recipe., , She was generous enough to share her recipe. If you prefer to make the batter from scratch then this may be useful., , 1/4 cup urad dal, 1 cup rice, 1 cup beaten rice or poha, pinch of methi seeds., , \u25a2, 1\u00bd, , cups, , idli batter, , thick or dosa batter, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , onion, , finely chopped (1 small, \u00bc cup if using directly), \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , carrot, , grated (optional), \u25a2, 2, , green chilies, , chopped (skip for kids), \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , grated ginger, \u25a2, 6, , curry leaves, , torn or fine chopped, \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , coriander leaves, , fine chopped (optional), \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , mustard seeds, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , oil, , for seasoning, \u25a2, 1, , pinch, , hing, , (optional), \u25a2, 2 to 3, , tablespoons, , oil, , as needed for the frying, \u25a2, salt, , if needed, , \u25a2, Heat a pan with oil and add mustard seeds. When they crackle, add curry leaves. Saute for a min., \u25a2, Add onions, chilies and carrots. Saute until the onions turn pink or raw smell disappears. Add ginger and saute for a minute., \u25a2, Then add coriander leaves and hing. Cool this and add to the batter., Make Kuzhi Paniyaram, \u25a2, Taste the batter and add more salt if needed. Batter must be of medium consistency not very thin or thick. If needed sprinkle some water., \u25a2, Season the paniyaram pan and heat it with few drops of oil in each cavity.  (Check notes to season your cast iron pan), \u25a2, When the pan is hot enough, pour batter up to \u00be in each mold. Lower the heat and cook for 2 mins. If desired you can cover and cook., \u25a2, When the base is golden fried, remove the lid and fry for another minute,. Turn them and cook until golden on the other side too. I usually check by poking a paniyaram with a fork or skewer to check if it is done inside., \u25a2, Remove them to a plate. To make the next batch, reduce the heat and pour few drops of oil in each cavity. Pour the batter and cook the same way., \u25a2, Serve masala paniyaram with chutney or sambar., , , Notes, , To Season your paniyaram pan, heat the pan first until very hot. Reduce the heat, pour few drops of oil in each cavity and spread it well with a kitchen tissue or cloth. Easier way is to tie a cloth over a chop stick or a spoon and use it to spread oil. Increase the heat and let the pan become smoking hot. Turn off the stove. When the temperature comes down, wipe off the excess oil. I prefer to do this after every use so it is ready for the next use. Please ventilate your kitchen well before doing this., , The pan has to be hot and not smoking hot. It has to be hot enough otherwise the paniyaram will stick to the pan and won\u2019t be able to remove them. So do not pour the batter before the pan is hot., , If the batter is too thick, your paniyaram will come out dense. If the batter is runny they will come out soft. Over fermented batter sometimes won\u2019t cook well. So whisk it well with a fork before using to make it less lighter., , , , , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Paniyaram Recipe | Kuzhi Paniyaram | Gunta Ponganalu, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 257, , Calories from Fat 9, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 1g, 2%, Sodium, 28mg, 1%, Potassium, 13mg, 0%, Carbohydrates, 41g, 14%, Fiber 16g, 67%, Protein, 19g, 38%, , , Vitamin A, 210IU, 4%, Vitamin C, 12.7mg, 15%, Calcium, 51mg, 5%, Iron, 6.1mg, 34%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , Paniyaram Recipe first published in April 2016.

I have a non-stick paniyaram pan from prestige omega select (double handle). Used it just for 3 to 4 months, while I was in Bangalore a few months ago. It was good. You have to check carefully for scratches if you order online. Also look into the reviews on amazon. I read the glass lid shatters so bought a separate steel lid. Iwachu products are available in India but not sure if they are online. I also wanted to let you know about the ovens which you asked earlier. Look for a Glen oven (not a toaster), their 65 lt is best.

No problem. Scrub and clean up the pan well. Heat the pan until it turns hot. Turn off the stove and smear some oil with a cloth on the hot pan. Place it back on the stove and heat it on a medium heat until it begins to emit smoke. Keep your kitchen well ventilated during this time. Let it cool down. Repeat this thrice before you start making the paddu. Sometimes even after doing this it won\u2019t become fully non-stick. Just do this again a few times. But make sure you don\u2019t use any detergent for cleaning and also don\u2019t season the pan when it is cold.

with step by step photo and video recipe. south indian cuisine is known for its healthy and tasty rice and lentil-based breakfast recipes. these are super popular across india, but has lead to so many innovations and alternatives to these traditional breakfast recipes. one of the traditional recipes are rice and lentil dough-based appe recipes which can also be done instant way with only rice flour and additional spices to make it more tasty and healthy., , instant paddu or appe is not a new recipe and is made with either rava, besan, or even with a choice of lentil. but preparing just with rice flour is very new which should produce the same texture and flavour of idli batter. it is primarily due to the addition of rava with rice flour, otherwise, the appe may sink while frying. the other advantage of this recipe is, it takes only 10 mins to prepare and serve this recipe and there is no soaking, grounding, and fermentation. most of the time, we forget to soak and prepare the batter for idli & dosa recipes. hence we end up making 2 minutes maggi, or the same poha or upma recipes. but having an instant version of the traditional recipes is always handy. you may surprise your friends or family with such a healthy breakfast without much preparation and planning., , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions, and variants to the instant rice appe recipe. firstly, the combination of rice flour and rava is very important, and do not attempt this recipe with just rice flour. the addition of semolina gives the rough texture and also helps to provide and hold the ball shape. secondly, you may not have appe pan handy as it is purpose-based and used only for preparing appe\u2019s. in that case, you may use dosa or chapathi pan too and pour the batter in small batches to form an appe. lastly, i have shared this recipe with a spicy green coriander chutney which makes it an ideal combination for this recipe. but you may also try this with other types of chutney including different types of sambar to go with it., , finally, i request you to check my other related, breakfast recipes collection, with this post of, rice paddu recipe, . it mainly includes my

        "Appe Pan Punugulu": "Ingredients: , You can then serve a batch of hot evening snack to your guests in no time. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is that, you should serve these punugulu only to your guests., , Don't ever make the mistake of even accidentally tasting one. Then for sure your guests will have none left., , These are nicely crispy on the outside, soft n spongy inside and you will never be able to stop yourself with eating just one. It is definitely very addictive \ud83d\ude42, , , 1, , Cup, , Idli Batter, 1, , pinch, , Baking soda, 1, , pinch, , Salt, 1, , pinch, , Asafoetida, 1, , pinch, , Red chilli powder, \u00bd, , tsp, , Jeera, 4, , Curry leaves, , (finely chopped), 1, , Tbsp, , Coriander leaves, , (finely chopped), 2, , Tbsp, , Onion, , (finely chopped), \u00bd, , Tbsp, , Semolina / Rava, 1 \u00bd, , Tbsp, , Rice Flour, , (adjust as needed), Oil, , - for frying, , except the oil. Mix well to form the batter in the right consistency., , , , , , Heat oil in a kadai for frying. Using your fingers take a small portion of the\u00a0batter, shape it into a rough ball and drop it gently in the hot oil. You can also instead drop spoonfuls of the batter, , , , , , , Fry in medium flame and in batches until the punugulu is nicely golden. Transfer to a paper napkin | paper towel | clean kitchen towel to remove excess oil., , , , , , Serve the delicious punugulu hot along with any spicy chutney, like coconut chutney or peanut chutney or tomato chutney or allam pachadi | ginger chutney, , Notes | FAQ, - The punugulu will taste best when the batter is a few days old and tastes slightly sour. Hence prefer using leftover idli batter or leftover dosa batter., , - Always fry in small portions. If you drop too many while deep frying, it will quickly reduce the temperature of oil and the punugulu will not come out good., , - Quantity of the rice flour added would purely depend on how thick your idli batter is. So add a little initially and then add more if needed. You may also use less if your batter is already thick., , - If the batter ends up thick, the bonda will turn out hard instead of getting a soft punugulu., , - If the batter ends up thin, the bonda will absorb a lot of oil while frying and you will not get a crispy punugulu. So adjust the consistency of batter accordingly., , - Instead of red chilli powder, you can also add finely chopped green chilies (green chillies), , , , , , , \u00ab, M&M's\u00ae Chocolate Toffee Bark, Speckled Chocolate Easter Egg Cake with Custard filling, \u00bb, Reader Interactions, Comments, , , , , , Datta burra, , says, , , August 28, 2020 at 10:59 am, , , , Just tried came out very tasty... thans for the recipy, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ira, , says, , , November 20, 2019 at 5:10 am, , , , It came out.v.tasty. kids loved it., , , Reply, , , , , , , , revifood, , says, , , December 03, 2019 at 6:54 am, , , , Thanks Ira for trying and glad your kids loved it \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , \u00ab Older Comments, , , Leave a Reply, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , Recipe Rating, , , , Recipe Rating, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Comment, *, , Name, *, , , Email, *, , , Love Revi's Foodography ?
