        "Rava Dosa": "Ingredients: , , , , , , Jump To Recipe, , , , , 14.3K, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , About Rava Dosa, , thin, aromatic and delicious., , Traditionally dosas, are made by soaking & blending rice and lentils to a batter. This is then fermented overnight & used. Making traditional dosas need a bit of planning, soaking and fermenting which is a 2 day process., , These instant rava dosas are a great replacement to the traditional version since these can be made instantly without having to soak, blend & ferment the batter. For this reason these dosas are made often in the South Indian households., , In Karnataka Tiffin centers, different kinds of rava dosas are made. Plain, rava masala, onion rava masala, dry fruits rava dosa are some of those. Rava masala dosa is one of the most popular and is made by stuffing potato masala similar to the, masala dosa., , About This Recipe, , This rava dosa recipe is pretty straight forward and is the same as it is made in every household and South Indian restaurants. This is a recipe which cannot be altered, meaning the proportions of rava, rice flour and all-purpose flour are always the same. Any changes to this is more likely to break the dosas., , ginger, chilies, cumin and yogurt is up to you since these are added for flavor., , More, Breakfast Recipes, Bhatura recipe, Upma recipe, Sabudana khichdi, Poha recipe, , , Photo Guide, , How to make Rava Dosa (Stepwise Photos), , Make batter, , 1. Add \u00bd cup fine rava (semolina) to a large mixing bowl. I have used non roasted rava., , , , 2. To the same bowl, add, , \u00bd cup rice flour, \u00bc cup all-purpose flour (maida), \u00bd teaspoon salt, \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera), \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon crushed black pepper, , , , 3. Next add, , 2 to 3 tablespoons onions (very fine chopped), 1 green chili chopped (skip for kids), 6 curry leaves finely chopped, 2 tablespoons coriander leaves (finely chopped), 1 teaspoon grated ginger, , , , 4. Add 1 tbsp curd (optional). This gives a golden color to your rava dosas but can be skipped. Pour 2\u00bd cups water to make a runny batter., , , , 5. Mix everything well and make a lump-free batter. It has to be very runny and watery. Taste it and add more salt if needed. Cover and rest this for 20 mins., , , , 6. Heat a non-stick or cast iron pan on a medium high heat. When the pan turns hot, drizzle few drops of oil & grease it well with a sliced onion or a kitchen tissue or cloth. Wipe off the excess oil., , Adjust the consistency, : After resting batter does turn slightly thicker, so at this stage recheck the consistency of the batter by stirring it. If needed add more water and mix. It has to be more like watery. I added about 2 to 3 tbsps more at this stage., , Make Rava Dosa on Hot Tawa, , 7. Stir the batter very well every time before you pour it to make a rava dosa. Ensure the pan is very hot and then pour the batter beginning from the edges across the pan. Next fill up the gaps in between. Do not pour the batter in one place. If your batter is very very thin you will get paper thin dosas with large holes. Once done with pouring the batter, reduce the flame to low., , , , 8. This was another time I made moderately thin rava dosas and not very very thin. This is how I make most of the times. Turn down the flame to low. Pour 1 tsp ghee or oil around the edges & on top., , , , 9. Let the rava dosa toast well on a low flame until the edges leave the pan.  When done, the edges of the rava dosa will come off the pan easily. This is the time you know it is done. The batter will cook through well and shrink a bit., , , , 10. When you see all the batter is cooked fully, then fold and remove the rava dosa to a serving plate., Troubleshooting:, Not all dosas need to be cooked on the other side. If your\u2019s is browning at the bottom and still moist on top, then flip it and cook for 30 to 60 seconds. Lastly flip it back and toast until crisp.  I did not toast mine on the other side., , , , Before you make the next rava dosa, ensure the pan is hot enough. Then stir the batter well and then pour. The batter may thicken after a while. Just add more water and stir it as and when needed. Rava dosa is best served hot with a chutney. Serve them directly from the pan. They tend to turn softer when they cool down., , Here are some sides you may want to try, Coconut chutney, Veg kurma, Tomato chutney, Potato masala, Tiffin sambar, , , , Expert Tips, , A well-made rava dosa will have a crisp, thin and porous texture. Here are some tips that may be helpful., , 1., Use fine rava, : Make sure you use only fine semolina also known as Bombay rava. Do not try this with other kinds of rava like whole wheat rava or bansi rava. The larger grains & bran in these kinds will prevent the dosas from roasting well and may break them., , 2., Consistency of batter, has to be thin and of pourable. The consistency of the batter determines the texture of the rava dosa. Runny batter creates a porous texture here. You can make them anywhere from paper thin to moderately thin by adjusting the consistency of batter., , 3., Using the right kind of pan, is crucial here. I make these dosas on a non-stick as well on a cast iron pan. If using a cast iron or an iron pan then it has to well-seasoned with oil. You can also use sliced onion to rub the pan before making every dosa. Do not try making these on a griddle that you use for toasting roti or naan., , 4., Flame & temperature, : The pan has to be hot enough while you pour the batter. But cook on a low heat to get them crisp. Do not toast them on a high heat. The dosa will brown without turning crisp., , 5., Roasting, : Remove the rava dosa when the edges begin to leave the pan. Do not forcibly pull it out from the pan. A well-cooked rava dosa leaves the edges from the pan on its own which is an indication that it is done., , 6., Pour the batter & not spread, : To make traditional dosas, the batter is spread on the tawa. But here it has to be poured over the hot pan. Pour it all over the pan instead of spreading., , Seasoning tawa, , 1. The key to make good rava dosas is a good tawa / griddle. If using a non-stick pan, then it can just be used straight away as it needs no seasoning. However many people use cast iron griddles to make their dosas. So sharing these tips for beginners:, , 2. Heat your cast iron pan first. When it becomes very hot, reduce the flame to low and pour \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon oil. Spread the oil gently with a kitchen tissue or a cloth. Be careful as the pan is hot. Continue to heat on a medium flame until it begins to smoke. Turn off and cool down. Your pan is ready to make rava dosa., , 3. If your pan is new, then repeat this process 3 to 4 times until a thin glossy coating is visible on the pan. Every time you heat the pan with oil, a layer of fats will burn off on the pan and this creates a patina over it. So your pan will be absolutely non-sticky, , Tricks, , If you have\na large family then these points may be helpful., , 1. Making a lot of these dosas isn\u2019t easy as they take double the amount of time to cook than a regular dosa. So it is good to make them on 2 different pans (on 2 burners) at one time., , 2. Rava dosas are very light and are not filling if you eat them with a chutney. So it is good to pair them with a simple potato masala., , 3. Lastly If you make them very very thin or paper thin, then you may need to make a lot of them as they are not filling at all. Next I make them moderately thin and not paper thin. Plan accordingly when you make the batter., , Troubleshooting, , 1., Dosa sticks to the pan, : Grease the pan well. If needed rub it with a slice of onion before you pour the batter to make the dosa. Repeat this for every dosa., , 2., Rava dosa is thick, : If the batter is not thin enough then you will get thicker and dense dosas. Add more water if it is thick., , 3., Dosa breaks, if the batter is excessively runny. Add a few tsps of flour and rava proportionately., , , Related Recipes, , Wheat Dosa | Godh..., , , Oats Dosa Recipe, , , Neer Dosa Recipe, , , Tomato Chutney Re..., , , Coconut Chutney R..., , , Veg Kurma Recipe ..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Rava Dosa Recipe, , , 5, from, 174, votes, , , , Instant rava dosas are South Indian breakfast crepes made with semolina, spices, herbs and flour.

Add more water and bring it to a runny consistency., \u25a2, Taste the batter and add more salt if needed. Rest the batter for 20 mins., How to Make Rava Dosa, \u25a2, Heat dosa pan on a medium high heat. If using cast iron pan, then drizzle few drops of oil over the pan and spread it well with a sliced onion or kitchen tissue or cloth. Wipe off the excess oil & let it heat., \u25a2, While the pan heats, stir the batter well. Ensure it is very runny and is pourable. At this stage you can add more water to bring to the desired consistency., \u25a2, When the pan is hot enough, stir the batter very well and begin to pour it from the edges across the pan in a circular motion., \u25a2, Then fill up the gaps if any by pouring more batter., \u25a2, Reduce the flame to low. Pour 1 tsp oil across the edges and a little over the rava dosa., \u25a2, When it is done cooking, it will begin to peel off the edges on its own. Do not pull the dosas forcibly., \u25a2, If you make very very thin (paper thin dosas) then you don't need to cook on the other side., \u25a2, When the rava dosa base becomes crisp & golden, remove it to a serving plate., \u25a2, Optionally If the rava dosa has browned at the bottom but still moist on top, then you can also flip and toast the dosa on the other side. And back again., To Make Next Rava Dosa, \u25a2, Ensure the pan is hot again., \u25a2, Stir the batter well before pouring the batter every time. If needed add more water to bring it to consistency., \u25a2, It is best served hot as it turns soft when it cools down. Serve with any chutney., , , Notes, , I have tried this recipe with maida, oats flour & whole wheat pastry flour. To make oat flour add oats to a blender and make a slightly coarse powder and use it. I have also made this a few times with whole wheat pastry flour used in baking., , Yogurt (curd) helps the suji dosas to get a golden color and also enhance the aroma. Adding more may make them soft., , Ensure onions and chilies are very fine chopped otherwise they don\u2019t cook well., , After resting the batter, rava will absorb some amount of water. So you may need to adjust the consistency by adding more water., , If you are a beginner, you need to practice a bit to make them perfect.

        "Instant Bun Dosa": "Ingredients:  Instructions: ",
        "Quinoa Dosa": "Ingredients: How to make Quinoa Dosa?, Tips for perfect crispy and thin dosa, Common Questions, Quinoa Dosa Recipe, , Why use Quinoa?, , Quinoa is one of the most healthy foods that comes filled with nutritious fibers, minerals, and antioxidants., , Quinoa comes with many, health benefits, like:, , , It is very, high in fiber, compared to other whole grains, , It is a perfect choice for people allergic to gluten and for those following a, gluten-free, diet., , Quinoa provides an excellent source of, protein, , It has a, low glycemic index, , which is good for keeping your blood sugar in control, , , These reasons make quinoa a superfood, and it is a versatile ingredient that works well with other recipes as well. I regularly make many recipes with quinoa, like quinoa pulao, Vegetarian Quinoa Chili, and, Quinoa Khichdi, ., , , While the traditional dosa recipe calls for urad dal and rice and has a fermenting time of 6-10 hours, this high-protein quinoa dosa uses quinoa, oats, and lentils and will be ready almost instantly., , , , Quinoa, : I used white quinoa; however, you can use other color quinoa as well. Just remember the dosa color will be different depending on the quinoa you use., , Rolled oats, : These help to give a crispy texture to dosa., , Urad dal, : Adds its signature crispiness to the dosa and retains the original flavor., , Chana dal, : Gives the right amount of crunch to the dosa., , Methi Seeds:, I also add methi seeds to the dosa, which adds crispiness and can help with fermentation if you want to keep this batter for some time before making the dosa., , , You can also use toor dal or split green moong dal in this batter. With the green moong dal, the dosa will be a bit greenish due to the green lentils., , , How to make Quinoa Dosa?, , Let\u2019s start with getting the quinoa dosa batter ready for easy, thin, and crispy dosas., , Soak and Grind the Batter, , , , Soak them all together in the same bowl for 4-5 hours or overnight., , After the soaking time is done, drain the water completely and transfer it to a high-speed blender jar., , , , , Add some peeled ginger, green chili, and salt to the blender. Green chili is optional and can be skipped., , Add cold water gradually to the mix as you blend for a smooth texture. Be careful while adding water, as too much water can make the batter watery., , Transfer the smooth batter to a large bowl. The consistency of the batter should not be too thick or runny; it should be free-flowing without any lumps., , , , Keep the batter for an hour before using. However, if you have less time, it is okay to use the batter right away. I have tried it, and it works!, , Making Quinoa Oats Dosa, , Now that we have the batter ready, the next step is to make crispy dosa. Usually, I use a cast iron griddle; we call it Tawa in India. You can also use a non-stick dosa tawa, but the cast iron griddle is the best for making this quinoa dosa., , But one thing to note is that the, cast iron pan is well-seasoned;, if not, you will end up fighting with sticky dosa. Learn how to season a cast iron pan here. One of the interesting things about a cast iron pan is that it gets seasoned with use. In case you have a new pan, don\u2019t keep it aside; keep using it!, , Be it a cast-iron or non-stick Tawa, set the, heat on medium-high, and make sure the Tawa is, heated well before making dosa, . You can test the heat by sprinkling some water, and if it sizzles right away, your Tawa is ready for the batter., , Smear a, few drops of oil, on the Tawa with the help of a paper towel. Alternatively, you can also use a, half-cut onion, to spread the oil. The smeared oil helps cool down the Tawa and spread the batter in a thin layer., , While spreading the batter, , lower the heat, a little bit and switch back to medium-high right after spreading the batter., , Always take a ladle of batter, pour it at the center, and start spreading it immediately in a circular motion. You can go clockwise like I usually do or anti-clockwise and try to spread it as thin as possible., , , If you are new to dosa, don\u2019t worry much about the shape; you will get it soon enough with practice. Drizzle oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and also some at the center., , Let it cook until the dosa becomes, golden brown, and starts to leave or come out from the edges. Typically, you, only need to cook one side, of the dosa, but if you are new to it and the batter is thick, then flip it over like pancakes to cook the other side., , Always use a flat spatula to remove the dosa without breaking from the Tawa. You either roll it or fold it at the center like a paper with a spatula. Remove from the Tawa and serve it piping hot., , , Always remember to wipe the tawa with a paper towel before the next dosa and repeat the same steps above for a crunchy quinoa dosa.\u00a0You can also use the half-cut onion trick to spread the oil and cool down the tawa., , , Serve the dosa with, sambar, ,, chutney,, and, potato masala, ., , This quinoa dosa batter can be used to make delicious uttapam too., , Tips for perfect crispy and thin dosa, , , Batter:, One of the most important things to make crispy dosa is the perfect batter, 1x, 2x, 3x, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , Quinoa, \u25a2, 1/2, , cup, , Rolled Oats, \u25a2, 1/2, , cup, , Urad Dal, , , or whole urad gota, \u25a2, 1/2, , cup, , Split Chickpeas (Chana dal), , , *see notes, \u25a2, 1/2, , teaspoon, , Fenugreek seeds (Methi dana), \u25a2, 1, , inch, , Ginger, \u25a2, 1-2, , Green Chili Pepper, , , optional, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , Salt, , , use non-iodized salt if fermenting*, \u25a2, Oil or Ghee, , , to make dosa, US Customary, \u2013, Metric, , and wholesome recipes made using Instant Pot & Air Fryer, that are well tested, so you can cook with confidence., , Read More About Me, , , You May Also Like, , Lentils & Beans, Vegetable Sambar / South Indian Lentils \u2013 Instant Pot Pressure Cooker, Rice & Grains, Idli Dosa Batter, South Indian, Steamed Idli (Savory Rice Cakes) \u2013 Instant Pot Pressure Cooker, Desserts, Carrot Kheer (Carrot Payasam), , , Get new recipes sent to your inbox!, Don't miss out!

Soak in about 4 cups of water for 4-5 hours., Drain water from the soaked quinoa and lentils. Add to a high speed blender jar. Add\u00a0ginger, green chili pepper\u00a0and salt., Add about 1 cup cold water as needed to grind the batter to a smooth paste.\u00a0Start with less water and add as needed., Transfer the batter to a large  bowl and let\u00a0it rest for about 30 minutes. The batter consistency should neither be thick nor runny, but rather it should be free flowing., Making the Dosa, Heat a cast iron griddle (tawa) on medium-high heat. You can also use a non-stick dosa tawa, but cast iron is best for crispy dosa's., Make sure the tawa is heated well before making dosa. You can sprinkle some water to and it should sizzle right away., Put a few drops of oil on the tawa and spread with a paper towel all over the tawa. You can also use an onion cut in half and use the flat side to spread the oil. This helps to cool down the tawa and spread the batter in a thin layer. Lower the heat a little while spreading the batter, and change back to medium-high right after spreading the batter., Take a ladle full of the batter and pour at the center of the tawa. Immediately start to spread the batter from the center out in a circular motion in one direction (I prefer clockwise). Try to spread as thin as possible., Drizzle oil or ghee around the egdes of the dosa and also some at the center. Let it cook until the dosa becomes golden brown and starts to leave or come out from the edges., You typically only need to cook one side of the dosa.

Then increase heat to high., Serve dosa with, sambar, ,, chutney, and, potato masala, ., , Notes, Other Lentils:, You can also add toor dal, or split green lentils or split Masoor Dal in this recipe.

Otherwise the batter does not spread properly and sticks to the pan. Follow the tips in the recipe.

        "Rava Uttapam": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make rava uttapam with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , rava uttapam recipe | instant suji uttapam recipe | sooji uttapam, with step by step photo and video recipe. uttapam recipes are the traditional dosa variety from the popular south indian morning breakfast cuisine. it is typically made with specific dosa batter or idli batter which includes batter grounding and batter fermentation. but there are some cheat version of it which is made instantly without the overnight hassle and rava uttapam recipe is one such popular variation., , as i explained earlier, there is no hassle of fermentation and grounding. the rava or sooji batter is made by mixing yoghurt, spices and salt. the traditional, instant suji uttapam recipe, is made with grounding and overnight fermentation, but this recipe post skips all those steps. moreover, i have not added any fermenting agent like baking soda and eno, fruit salt, . these agents typically help to hasten the fermentation process which can also be added to this batter. but i have specifically avoided as it is not required particularly for this recipe. the combination of semolina and curd makes the batter ideal for dosa recipes., , , furthermore, i would also like to highlight some tips, suggestions and variations for this, instant suji uttapam recipe, . firstly, i would heavily recommend using medium-sized semolina or bombay rava for this recipe. do not use bansi rava or thin sized semolina and it can mess up the batter and dosa making process. secondly, the choice of toppings can be varied and you can mix up any your choice vegetables. however, ensure to chop these veggies very finely so that it can be easily topped for these pancakes. lastly, i have shaped these uttapams in mini shaped disc which is not a requirement. you can shape it any required and there is no strict on it., , finally, i request you to check my other, dosa variety recipes collection, with this post of, rava uttapam recipe, . it mainly includes recipes like, vegetable uttapam, , , methi dosa, , , rava dosa, , , ghee roast dosa, , , poha uttapam, , , set

        "Wheat Dosa": "Ingredients: onions, and grated carrots are also optionally added., , In this post I share a good old Grandma\u2019s Godhuma dosa recipe. In a lot of traditional South Indian homes, these instant wheat dosas are commonly made by the women folks for their fasting dinners., , On religious occasions, a lot of them refrain from eating a full-meal and these wheat dosas are made for a fast and light dinner option. Growing up I would see my Mom and Grandma making these often for the same reason., , About this Recipe, , This recipe will help you make crisp, , You can also make uttapam with the same batter. Pour the batter to make a slightly thicker uttapam and sprinkle veggies like carrots, onions and tomatoes., , These go well with any kind of, Chutney, like easy, tomato, chutney, , mint, peanut chutney, , healthy, curry leaves chutney, ,, ginger chutney, or, capsicum chutney, ., , While I love adding some buttermilk or yogurt to make the wheat dosa batter, you are free to add some milk or even plain water. Buttermilk or yogurt imparts a unique flavor, makes your dosas golden and gives the wheat dosa a slight tang., , Milk imparts a milky and rich aroma and tastes different from the buttermilk version. If you want you can add 2 tbps milk per cup of wheat flour., , , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Wheat Dosa (Stepwise photos), , Make batter, , , \u00bd\u00a0cup wheat flour, \u00bc cup rice flour, 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon hing, 1 pinch of cumin seeds, 5 to 6 chopped curry leaves, 1 green chilli finely chopped, \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon grated ginger, 2 tablespoons onions very finely chopped (optional), 1 tablespoon curd (yogurt) (optional), , I have not used onions here. If you use curd, you will get golden colored godhuma dosas., , , 2. Add water little by little as needed and make a thin batter. You will need about 1 to 1 \u00bc cups (little more or less). Make sure the batter is thin to get a netted dosa. Break up lumps if you find any., , , Make Wheat Dosa, , 3. If the tawa used doesn\u2019t have a nonstick coating, grease the pan. Heat the pan and then pour few drops of oil. Spread it evenly all over with a piece of onion, cloth or kitchen tissue., , , 4. When the tawa is hot, pour the batter evenly from a little height in a circular pattern. Fill up the gaps. Do not try to spread like the regular dosas. Just pour it evenly. Ensure the pan is hot enough before pouring the batter., , , 5. Add little oil towards the edges & on the dosa as well. Cook the wheat dosas on a medium low flame. These dosas will take some time to cook. When done, the base of the dosa begin to turn golden crisp and the edges will leave the pan on their own., , , 6. Once done, flip the dosa and cook on the other side. This is optional. Thin dosas need not be cooked on the other side., , , Serve wheat dosa with chutney., , , To make the next wheat dosa, ensure the pan is hot and stir the batter well. The solids will settle at the bottom in the bowl. Give a good stir before pouring. If the pan is extremely hot, sprinkle little water to bring down the heat of the pan. Heat it again and then stir and pour.

I am just wondering if you have used indian atta or wheat flour (from any other country). Since most indian atta sold is not very fine, it works well.

If using curd you can also add it now., \u25a2, The batter has to be runny of free flowing (pouring consistency). Else add more water and bring it to the consistency., \u25a2, If using a pan that doesn\u2019t have a non-stick coating, heat it first and then add few drops of oil to the pan., \u25a2, Rub oil on the tawa with a small piece of onion or kitchen tissue., How to Make Wheat Dosa, \u25a2, Heat it on a medium high flame. The pan has to be hot but not extremely smoking hot. When the tawa is hot enough. stir the batter well.  (the trick here is hot pan but not smoking hot that it burns the dosa), \u25a2, Pour the batter from a little height starting from the sides all around the pan. Fill up the gaps if any. Do not spread it like a normal dosa., \u25a2, Drizzle some oil towards the edges & on the dosa as well. Let it cook on a medium to low heat., \u25a2, When it is cooked, you will see the edges leaving the pan on its own. Wheat dosa also turns golden and crisp. Lift the dosa with a wooden spoon., \u25a2, If the wheat dosa is very thin you don't need to cook on the other side. If it is thick then flip it and cook on the other side as well. Flip back and cook to get a crispy dosa., \u25a2, To make more dosas, if the tawa is extremely hot sprinkle little water. The water evaporates quickly, wait for the pan to heat again. Then stir the batter well with a ladle and pour it the same way., \u25a2, Serve wheat dosa with your favorite chutney., , , Notes, , Ensure the onions are chopped very finely otherwise the the dosa may remain uncooked in some parts., , Stir the batter well before making every dosa. The solids settle down at the bottom so it is essential to stir every time before pouring the batter., , The pan has to be hot but not extremely smoking hot when you pour the batter. If it is not hot enough you won\u2019t get the netted and crisp dosas., , Also cooking them on a medium to low heat for some time is essential for crisp wheat dosas., , , , , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Wheat Dosa | Godhuma Dosa, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 89, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Sodium, 4mg, 0%, Potassium, 16mg, 0%, Carbohydrates, 18g, 6%, Protein, 2g, 4%, , , Vitamin C, 0.3mg, 0%, Calcium, 5mg, 1%, Iron, 0.7mg, 4%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , Wheat Dosa recipe first Published in February 2015.

It should be damp and not completely dry. Powder it in a grinder and sieve. Dry this flour completely or roast in on a low flame to remove the moisture.

I guess if the rice flour is not fresh then it breaks. You can try using milk instead of buttermilk. The fastest way to prepare curries is to cook covered on a low flame, adding less water and only as required. Cooking foods at high temperature not only consumes more gas but also the texture of food isn\u2019t good., These are some of the common tips.

Do not make the batter runny as the pesarattu will not turn crispy., \u25a2, Optional \u2013 topping:, heat 1 tablespoon ghee or oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds, onions and green chilies. Saute them on a medium high flame until transparent yet crunchy. This will bring out the sweet flavor from the onion. They should not turn soft. Cool these completely., How to make pesarattu, \u25a2, Heat a tawa or non-stick griddle on a medium flame., \u25a2, If using a cast iron pan, when it turns hot, drizzle few drops of oil or ghee and rub with a piece of sliced onion. Wipe off the excess. This prevents the pesarattu from sticking to the pan.\u00a0If using non-stick pan you don't need to grease it., \u25a2, Test by sprinkling little water. Immediately water should sizzle rapidly. When the water evaporates, reduce the flame to medium heat., \u25a2, Pour \u00bd to \u00be cup of batter on the tawa. Then quickly spread it to a thin layer beginning from the center, moving towards the edges of the pan., \u25a2, On a low to medium heat let the pesarattu cook for a few minutes. Pour 1 teaspoon ghee around the edges and the center too., \u25a2, This step is optional for a thin pesarattu., Lightly scrape off the thick parts with a wooden spatula to the thinner parts making it even. (Check my step-by-step photos above), \u25a2, When the pesarattu is done, you will see the edges begin to leave the pan.\u00a0It also cooks to golden color & crisp on the outside., \u25a2, Then flip and cook on the other side just for a minute or so. When you see the batter is no more raw, then flip back and roast just for a minute until crisp., Optional, \u2013 Sprinkle 1 to 2 teaspoons of the fried onions here as much as you like., \u25a2, Fold it and remove to serving plate. Do not over cook until it browns or discolors as the taste will alter., \u25a2, To make the next pesarattu, ensure the pan is not too hot. Reduce the flame and cool down a bit. If using cast iron pan, you can rub it well with the onion and few drops of oil., \u25a2, Stir the batter well before making the next one and then use it., \u25a2, These pesarattu are best served hot with this, ginger chutney, .

It needs practice. I guess the batter was a bit more thick than needed. That could be the reason for the dosas being thick. I would also suggest not to make a lot of these until you become an expert. Try making with only half cup & cut down the soaking time to 3 hours. I remember my Mom would wake up at 4:30 am only to soak the green gram and grind the batter by 7:30 am. Her pesarattu were the best because of less soak time.

My preparation used one cup of the soaked bean and added only enough water to make a proper consistency\u2026 pourable and spreadable., They are very tasty, though! Please let me know if mine are way to big and if so, would you revise the scoop measure for dropping batter onto the pan.

You can make about 6 to 9 inches depending on the size of your griddle. I use about 50 ml batter for a 9 to 10 inch pesarattu.

        "Masala Dosa": "Ingredients: , , 1.5 cups idli rice or parboiled rice in one bowl. You can also use regular short-grained to medium-grained rice like, sona masuri, or, parmal, ., , \u00bd cup urad dal (husked black gram) + 1 tablespoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) + 20 methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) in a second bowl, , \u2153 cup thick poha (flattened rice) in a third bowl., , , , , 2. Rinse the lentils and fenugreek seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in\u00a01 cup water for 4 to 5 hours., , Tip:, Ensure to use urad dal that are fresh and within their shelf-period., , , , 3. Rinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside., , , , 4. Rinse flattened rice once or twice and then add to the rice., , , , 5. Pour\u00a02 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours., , , , 6. Before grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils+fenugreek seeds and keep it for grinding urad dal. You can also use fresh water if you prefer., , , , 7. Add the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add \u00bd cup of the soaked and strained water to the lentils or \u00bd cup of fresh water if you like., , , , 8. Grind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the dosa batter ferments well., , , , 9. Remove batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula. Below is a photo showing the consistency of the urad dal batter., , Note that a well ground and fluffy urad dal batter helps in the fermentation process., , , , 10. Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar., , I ground in one batch and added 1 cup water for grinding. You can even add \u00be cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice. So you may need to add less or more water., , , , 11. Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency of the ground rice grains., , , , 12. Now pour the rice+flattened rice batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad lentil batter., , , , 13. Add \u00bd teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt., , , , 2. Ferment Batter, , 14. Mix the salt very well with the ground batter. Also, mix both the rice batter and the urad lentil batter thoroughly. Cover with a lid and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours at room temperature., , You can keep for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city. It can take anywhere from 6 hours to a day or more for it to ferment., , In the Indian summers, the batter ferments quickly and during winters it takes a longer duration of time., , , , 15. In the below photo, you see a well fermented batter the next day. I kept for about 13 hours and 35 minutes at room temperature, as it is cooler during the monsoons where we live., , If you live in a cold place, keep your batter in a lit, (but not heated), oven or keep near a warm place., , You can also use the yogurt setting of your Instant Pot to ferment. Use the \u201clow\u201d option when using the yogurt setting as the \u201cmedium\u201d option will cook the batter instead of fermenting it. Cover with a separate lid and not the Instant pot lid as it can get locked., , For fermenting batter in the instant pot, time will vary from 8 to 12 hours depending on your room temperature, season, altitude and geographical location., , During winters and cooler days, I always use the instant pot for fermenting dosa batter and it works like a charm., , A well fermented batter will double or triple in volume, have a pleasant sour aroma with many tiny air-pockets., , Once your batter is nicely fermented, cover and refrigerate it when you start to make the potato masala stuffing. In hotter seasons, the batter kept at room temperature will continue to ferment and will become very sour., , , , 3. Make Potato Filling, , 1. First rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker., , You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender., , , , 2. When the potatoes are cooking, rinse and soak 1 tablespoon chana dal in \u00bc cup hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain all the water from the chana dal and set aside., , If you are out of chana dal, then simply skip it., , , , 3. When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the potatoes and let them become warm., , , , 4. Then peel and chop them. Also, thinly slice 2 medium to large onions (200 grams) and chop 1 to 2 green chilies, finely chop 1 inch ginger and some coriander leaves. When you measure, you should have:, , , 1.25 cups thinly sliced onions, , 1 teaspoon chopped green chillies, , 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger, , 3 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves, , , , , 5. Heat oil or ghee in a frying pan or skillet. If using cashews, then fry 2 tablespoons cashews at this step and keep them aside., , Lower the heat and add mustard seeds and let them splutter. You can add \u00bd teaspoon cumin seeds while tempering., , , , 6. Then add the chana dal., , , , 7. Saute the chana dal for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat or till they turn light golden or golden., , , , 8. Now add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger., , , , 9.\u00a0Saut\u00e9 the onions till they soften and turn translucent. Stir often while saut\u00e9ing onions so that they get evenly cooked., , , , 10. Add the turmeric powder and asafoetida (hing). To make it gluten-free use the gluten-free asafoetida or skip it altogether., , , , 11.\u00a0Mix very well., , , , 11. Now add \u00bd cup water., , , , 12. Again mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit., , , , 12. Next add the boiled chopped potatoes., , , , 13. Mix very well. You can choose to mash the potatoes slightly while cooking., , , , 14. Season with salt according to taste. Also add \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon sugar for a slightly sweet taste. You can add more sugar if you prefer., , , , 14. And stir again., , , , 15.\u00a0 Simmer on a low to medium-low heat for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally., , , , 16. Switch off the heat and then add chopped coriander leaves.\u00a0Also add fried cashews now (if you have fried the cashews earlier as mentioned in step 5 above). Mix well., , , , 15. Stir and keep the potato masala aside.\u00a0The potato filling should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato stuffing. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency., , This is your basic potato masala for the masala dosa., , , , 4. Make Masala Dosa, , 1. Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa.\u00a0You will also see tiny air pockets in the batter with an increase in its volume., , , , 2. Heat a cast iron pan or a flat non-stick pan. The pan should be medium hot. Smear some oil if using an iron pan or griddle. Don\u2019t smear oil on a non stick pan, as then you won\u2019t be able to spread the batter easily., , Dosa batter has a medium-thick to medium flowing consistency and is easily pourable., , Tip 1:, If its too thick to spread, add a splash of water and mix it well., , Tip 2:, If it has become thin, add some rice flour to thicken it., , , , 3. Keep the heat to a low, while spreading batter., , , , 4. Spread the batter in a circular way on the pan. On a medium heat, cook the dosa., , , , 5. Sprinkle some oil on top and edges., , , , 6.\u00a0Cover the dosa with a lid and let it cook., , , , 7. Cook till its base becomes golden and crisp. You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon., , You can also opt to flip the dosa and cook the top side., , , , 8.\u00a0When you see the base has become golden, the edges have separated from the pan and the dosa has cooked, place a portion of the potato masala filling on the dosa. You can spread the filling a bit if you want., , If you prefer then you can choose not to place the potato stuffing in the dosa and instead serve it separately. Some people like to have masala dosa served this way. Simply cook the dosa without any added potato filling., , , , 9. Now fold the dosa and serve., , , , Serving Suggestions, , Serve crisp restaurant style masala dosa hot. It\u2019s delicious with sambar and coconut chutney, or your favorite dipping sauces or saucy dishes., , Apart from sambar and coconut chutney, masala dosa also taste good with onion chutney, tomato chutney and peanut chutney., , Storage and Leftovers, , The fermented rice and lentil batter stays good for 3 to 4 days in the fridge. You can opt to freeze it for a few weeks too. Store any leftover potato filling in the refrigerator for a day only., , , , Expert Tips, , , Rice:, I have used idli rice to make this masala dosa recipe. You can also use parboiled rice or any Indian varieties of short-grained to medium-grained rice, like sona masuri, surti kolam or parmal rice. Many of these rice variants are easily available online., , Flattened rice and chana dal:, Adding thick flattened rice (poha) and chana dal help to make the masala dosa both crisp and soft. It also gives the crepe that lovely golden color. You can skip the poha, chana dal, or both if you like, but if available I highly recommend you use in this masala dosa recipe., , Fenugreek Seeds:, To assist the fermentation process I add fenugreek seeds along with the rice and lentils to make the dosa batter. They also give a nice flavor to the dosa and also help in digestion. Leave out if you don\u2019t have, but again, I suggest you include the seeds if it available., , Proportion:, I find that the ideal proportion for the best dosas is, 3:1 of rice to lentils, . So to make this hotel style masala dosa recipe, I have used 1.5 cups idli rice with \u00bd cup of urad dal. I use the same recipe proportions to make, Ghee Roast Dosa, ., , Fermentation, : The rice and lentil batter must be properly fermented for the best masala dosa. You therefore need to store it overnight in a fairly warm place. If you are in a colder climate, keep it in the warmest part of the house and/or increase the fermentation time by some hours or so as needed., , Cooking Dosa:, You need to get the pan hot but not too hot for perfectly golden and crisp dosa. The skillet or nonstick pan should be hot enough to quickly cook and brown the crepe, but not so hot that the batter immediately sticks and cannot be spread evenly., If using a cast iron pan, sprinkle with water and wipe clean between cooking each dosa to keep the heat just right. For nonstick pans and skillets, first get the pan to become hot, then reduce the heat to low and spread on the batter. Increase the heat back to medium and continue to cook the dosa., , Make ahead:, The lentil and rice dosa batter can be made ahead and kept in the fridge, but should be used within 3 to 4 days after fermenting., , , More Tasty Dosa Recipes, Breakfast Recipes, Oats Dosa Recipe (Crispy Oats Crepes), Karnataka Recipes, Neer Dosa Recipe (Mangalorean Style), Breakfast Recipes, Set Dosa | Soft Sponge Dosa Recipe, Breakfast Recipes, Rava Dosa Recipe, , , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender., When the potaoes are cooking, soak the chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain the chana dal and keep aside., When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the water from the potatoes and let them become warm.\u00a0Then peel and chop them., Also slice the onions thinly and chop the green chilies, ginger and coriander leaves., Making potato filling, Heat oil or ghee in a frying pan or a skillet.

It should have a pleasant sour aroma and should increase in volume after fermentation. In a well fermented batter you will see many tiny air pockets. Ensure that you don\u2019t over ferment the batter as this will result in a very sour tasting dosa., , If using a cast iron pan, make sure it is well seasoned or else the dosa can stick on it., , According to me the ideal proportion for the best dosa is, 3:1 ratio of rice to lentils., However feel free to change and add some more lentils for a protein boost., , The fermentation depends on the temperature and climate in your city. In a cooler or colder climate the fermentation will take more than a day. To quicken it, I suggest to keep the batter in a warm place or use the yogurt settings of your Instant pot to ferment the batter., , , , Nutrition Info (Approximate Values), , Nutrition Facts, , Masala Dosa Recipe (Hotel Style), , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 111, , Calories from Fat 9, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 1g, 2%, Sodium, 65mg, 3%, Potassium, 111mg, 3%, Carbohydrates, 20g, 7%, Fiber 2g, 8%, Protein, 3g, 6%, , , Vitamin A, 5IU, 0%, Vitamin C, 2.6mg, 3%, Calcium, 17mg, 2%, Iron, 1.5mg, 8%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , Masala Dosa recipe from the archives was first published on January 2010., , Share This Recipe:, WhatsApp, Facebook, Pin, Tweet, Email, Shares, 6.7k, Meet Dassana, Welcome to Dassana's Veg Recipes.

prepared and stuffed similar to, veg spring roll, . in other words, prepared similar to, masala dosa, , but filled with stir fried veggies and noodles instead of, aloo bhaji or potato masala, . moreover, , schezwan chutney, is applied on top of, noodle dosa, which technically replaces the, red chutney., , well to be honest, i am not a huge fan of, schezwan dosa, or this fusion dosa recipe. i always prefer my favourite simple, masala dosa, or, mysore masala dosa recipe, . however my husband is crazy about this spring dosa recipe and always request me to prepare with left over, dosa batter, . perhaps he may have developed the taste for mumbai special schezwan dosa\u00a0because of his frequent visit to mumbai during his early career days. typically you can use any dosa batter, but i have used, home made masala dosa batter, prepared in mixer grinder., , , furthermore, some important tips and variations for this amazing fusion, chinese\u00a0dosa recipe, . firstly, the dosa batter has to be spread very thin very similar to, masala dosa, . this basically helps to spread the, schezwan sauce, easily and also to roll them and cut into, spring rolls, . secondly, i have used, home made schezwan sauce recipe, , alternatively you can also use chilli sauce as spread on top of dosa. lastly, you can serve these spring dosa with either south indian chutneys like, coconut chutney, or, tomato chutney, , but can also be served with chilli sauce or, soy sauce, ., , finally, i would request you to check my other, south indian dosa recipes collection, and, indo chineese recipes

        "Mixed veg Uttapam": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make veg uttapam with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , vegetable uttapam recipe | veg uttapam | mixed veggie uttapa, with step by step photo and video recipe. dosa recipes are very common across india and are made in a different capacity with a different texture. generally, it comes as a thin or a thick white-coloured crepe without any extra topping to it. yet there are other variations like uttapam where finely chopped veggies are added at the top and mixed veggie uttapa is one such variation., , i am a huge fan of crisp dosa and i generally prefer a crisp and roasted, masala dosa, for my breakfast. yet i end up making different types of dosa with soft and thick dosa variations. and uttapam is one such frequently made dosa options. the main reason to meet my husband\u2019s requirement. he likes to have soft and thick dosa, similar to, set dosa, . apparently he developed this taste, while he was living in, bangalore, . as a matter of fact, the idea of, mixed veggie uttapa, , comes from him and he likes to experiment with uttapa toppings. in this, i have experimented with capsicum, carrots, beans but not limited to it. i would recommend using those veggies which can be easily cooked on a dosa pan without much effort., , , anyway, before i conclude the post, i would like to highlight some tips, suggestions and variation to, vegetable uttapam recipe, . firstly, the batter is key for this recipe and it has to be coarse and thick compared to the traditional thin dosa batter. otherwise, you may not be able to get the desired thickness and also the topping may not hold. secondly, the vegetable toppings have to be finely chopped so that it does cook properly when added as a topping. also, it would be easy to arrange finely chopped veggies. lastly, the dish tastes great when served warm or served immediately. do not serve leftover or rested one, or try to preheat before serving it., , finally, i request you to check my other, dosa recipes collection, with this post of, vegetable uttapam recipe, . it mainly includes recipes collection variation like, methi dosa, , , rava dosa, , , ghee roast dosa, , , poha uttapam, , , set dosa, , , oats dosa, , , uttapam, , , kara dosa, , , tomato dosa, , , adai, . further to these i would also like to highlight

batter with fenugreek seeds. yet you can experiment the recipe further with rice and urad dal batter which should taste equally great. secondly, if you are living in a cold and dry place the fermentation process may take extra time. to hasten it, you can either store it in a preheated oven or direct in sun light. lastly, the ideal combination for this bitter dosa is to serve it with a spicy and savoury chutney or curry. when a spicy side, mixed with bitter dosa, it makes a nice combination., , finally, i request you to check my other, dosa recipes collection, with this post of,

        "Kara Dosa": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , How to make Kara Dosai with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , khara dosa recipe using spicy chutney:, , , , , 6, , dosa preparation:, , , , , 7, , Notes:, , , , , , , Kara Dosa Recipe | Uppu Huli Dose | How to make Spicy Kara Dosai, with step-by-step photo and video recipe. dosa is a staple for many south Indians and is mainly made for morning breakfast. it has evolved to many variations with its thickness, , As I mentioned earlier, dosa recipes are a very common breakfast recipe in most South Indian households. ideally, the dosa batter is made in bulk and it can easily go up to a week. it can be monotonous to have the same plain dosa variation every day, and hence a variation is introduced. I particularly try to make it different every time I make dosa and, kara dosai, is one such variation I make frequently. i make this spicy kara chutney well ahead in advance and store it in the fridge. it has a long shelf life which makes it easier to cook it once and use it again and again., , , , Furthermore, some important tips, suggestions and variations for perfect, kara dosa recipe or kara dosai recipe, . firstly, you can use almost any dosa batter variation for this recipe. I personally recommend using the, set dosa, or the batter which yields soft dosa. having said that it can also be used for thin and crisp dosa too. secondly, you can use the same kara chutney as a side dish too and can be served with, idli, , , upma, or, pongal, . moreover, you can control the spice level accordingly by increasing or decreasing the red, chillies, . finally, apply the chutney on top dosa, only after it has turned dry. do not apply when the batter is still wet and it may eventually lose its shape., , finally, do visit my other related, South Indian dosa recipes collection, with this post of, kara dosa recipe, . it includes recipes like, masala dosa, , , rava dosa, , , cheese dosa, , , mysore masala dosa, , , set dose, , , poha dosa, , , pav bhaji dosa, , , kal dosa, , ,

notes:, , , , , , stuffed dosa recipe | instant stuffed mini bun dosa | stuffed dosa pancake, with step by step photo and video recipe. breakfast recipes are one of the important meals compared to the other meals. we spend a lot of time thinking and preparing to make something interesting and healthy so that we aren\u2019t bored with the same set of breakfast recipes. one such innovative and fusion breakfast recipe from south india is an instant stuffed dosa pancake recipe., , as i was explaining, stuffed dosa, pancake, is one such simple and easy innovative recipe which does not only taste to consume but more importantly do not require any side with it. the spicy vegetable masala stuffed inside the dosa makes it a complete meal. you may perhaps prepare and pack it for lunch box or tiffin boxes, especially for kids. i generally make it with my leftover masala dosa batter but you may very well follow this instant dosa batter to a simple dosa or this, stuffed dosa, ., , , , , , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the, instant stuffed mini bun dosa, . firstly, the, stuffed dosa, is best prepared in a mini or small pan that holds the batter to shape it. you may also use the traditional dosa, pan, but may not get the same thickness as shown in this video. secondly, due to the thickness of the dosa, it has to be cooked on a slow flame for a minimum of 2 minutes on each side. this ensures that the dosa is fully and evenly cooked. lastly, in this video, i have shown and used mixed vegetable masala stuffing which should be ideal for stuffing. but you may also use leftover aloo masala or any dry sabji for stuffing., , finally, i request you to check my other related, instant recipes collection, with this post of, stuffed dosa

        "6 Gluten Free Dosas": "Ingredients:  Instructions: ",
        "Quinoa dosa": "Ingredients: with a mix of lentils and quinoa, is a super food and best of all, it couldn't be easier to make. Serve with south Indian, sambar, or, coconut chutney, ., , You might also like these recipes for, classic south Indian dosa, , , adai, and, rava dosa, ., , , I am always making different kinds of dosas in my kitchen because we love dosas around here, for a traditional, Indian breakfast, or lunch. I've shared with you many of these recipes, including, brown rice dosa, , , sorghum dosa, and, instant masala dosa, (as well as an, instant gluten-free masala dosa, )., , Among those recipes was also a quinoa dosa, which I called a quinoa crepe when I shared it back in 2013. This recipe has always been one of my favorites because it makes the crispiest dosas., , In the years since I've tweaked my quinoa dosa recipe to simplify it and to remove rice from it altogether (although you can add some if you want to--I'll tell you how). And I've also started to ferment the batter for its probiotic benefits, although you don't have to if you'd rather eat the quinoa dosa sooner., , I don't need to tell you the benefits of quinoa: this super grain has a large amount of protein with a wide range of amino acids, which makes it particularly beneficial for vegans, vegetarians and those who follow a gluten-free diet. It is also rich in fiber and antioxidants, and has B vitamins and iron, among tons of other benefits., , If you already love quinoa, these quinoa dosas are a great way to incorporate this healthy grain in your diet., , Why you'll love this quinoa dosa recipe, , , Super healthy, . I use a mix of three lentils and quinoa in this recipe. You can use just one kind of lentil, if you'd rather. Also, you can make these dosas probiotic by fermenting the batter overnight--a simple, hands-off process with huge benefits for your gut health., , Crispy and delicious, . The quinoa makes these dosas really, really crispy and crunchy, which makes it really kid-friendly as well. Jay has always loved dosas, but he loves these quinoa dosas just a bit more., , Easy to make, . If you've never made dosa before, there's no reason to be afraid. The only part that takes a bit of skill is actually making the dosa--spreading the batter on the skillet--and you don't have to be perfect to get good results. Stay with it and you'll get better as you practice., , Everyone friendly., These dosas are gluten-free, nut-free and soy-free--and vegan, of course, so anyone can eat them., , , , , , Quinoa., You can use quinoa of any color, and the dosa will look different-colored depending on which color you use., , Lentils., I use three commonly used Indian lentils in this recipe:, urad dal, (black gram dal), , chana dal, (Bengal gram dal) and, toor dal, (split pigeon peas). If you want to use just one dal, use urad dal and leave out the others. The mix adds great flavor and more healthfulness., , Fenugreek seeds, . You can leave out the fenugreek seeds, especially if you don't plan on fermenting the batter., , Salt to taste., , , , , , Would you like to save this recipe?, , Enter your email and I'll send this recipe to your inbox!, , , , , Check to get new recipe updates by email., , , , , , , How to make quinoa dosa, , , Wash and place rice, lentils and fenugreek seeds in a bowl., , Add water to cover by at least two inches. Soak for three hours or overnight. Drain all water before blending., , Add the quinoa and lentils to a blender bowl with enough water to make a batter. You can make the dosa rightaway or ferment the batter overnight., , Pour batter on a hot cast iron skillet with a steel or heat-safe ladle with a rounded bottom. Spread quickly going outward in a spiral., , Cook until the underside turns golden-brown., , Flip and cook a few more seconds to make the dosas extra crispy., , , , , Top tip, , Wash the quinoa thoroughly before use. This is best done by placing the quinoa in a fine-mesh colander and rinsing it under running water. Quinoa has a natural, protective coating of phytochemicals called saponins, which can make the quinoa taste bitter. But it's a problem easily taken care of by simply rinsing the quinoa., , , Serve, , , A traditional, sambar, is wonderful with quinoa dosa. You can also try variations like, onion sambar, or, white pumpkin sambar, ., , Serve the dosa with a simple, south Indian style, coconut chutney, and, potato sabzi, ., , Serve with this tasty, onion chutney, ., , , Quinoa dosa FAQs, , Can I use just one kind of lentil in the quinoa dosa?, , If you don't want to use three types of lentils, just go with urad dal. Always use the tiny white dal in this recipe, not the versions that have the black skin on., , , The old recipe you shared had rice in it. Can I still add rice?, , Most definitely. Replace half the quinoa with rice and proceed with the rest of the recipe., , , Crispy dosas look great, but I prefer softer dosas. Can I get that result with quinoa?, , Yes, just add \u00bcth cup of poha or flattened rice to the quinoa and lentils when you soak them., , , How do I store the quinoa dosas?, , Dosas are always best eaten right after you make them. If you have more batter than you need, store the batter in the refrigerator--it will be fine for at least four days to a week.

You can also scoop up the filling after tearing a bit of the dosa and then dip. With no potato just dunk in the sambar or chutney. In short, there is no wrong way to do this--it's delicious any way you eat it. \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Preethi, , , September 16, 2021 at 1:39 pm, , , , This was just what I needed  Thank you!

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: , Rinse the dals and quinoa and place in a bowl with fenugreek seeds, if using, and enough water to cover by at least two inches. Set aside to soak at least three hours or overnight., Drain and place the quinoa and lentils in a blender with enough water to keep the blades moving. Blend into a smooth paste. You can always mix in more water later if your batter is too thick. The dosa batter should have the consistency of a thin pancake batter minus the lumps., You can make the dosas rightaway after blending, or you can ferment the batter overnight to get healthier dosas. To ferment the batter, cover the bowl with a lid and place in a warm spot in your kitchen, or in a cold oven with the light turned on, overnight. The batter will become puffy after 8-10 hours, indicating that it is teeming with good-for-you bacteria. Stir in salt to taste at this point., To make the dosas, use a paper towel or the cut surface of half a potato or onion to rub a tiny bit of oil on the surface of a griddle. There should be no visible oil, you are just seasoning the griddle to ensure the dosa doesn't stick., Heat the griddle until water splattered on the surface sizzles and evaporates rightaway.  Using a ladle with a rounded bottom, place about \u2153rd cup of the dosa batter in the center of the griddle. Using the bottom of the ladle, start spreading the batter into a round, moving outward from the center in a spiral motion. Your dosa should be rather thin and crepe-like. Don't worry if you don't get this perfect the first few times--you'll get better with practice., Sprinkle a few drops of oil around the edges of the crepe. This helps the edge brown and become all crispy, and it helps release the dosa crepe. You can also use cooking spray, just turn the heat all the way down or off before spraying around the edges, for safety's sake., Let the bottom cook until golden-brown. If your dosa is thin enough, you don\u2019t really need to cook the other side, but if it is thick, flip it over and cook another 30 seconds., Serve hot with sambar or chutney., , , Notes, , Always make only the number of dosas you want to eat and refrigerate the batter until you want to make more. Dosas don't store very well once made. Eat them rightaway., , To make softer dosas, add \u00bc cup poha or flattened rice. You can also make the dosas thicker, which will keep them softer., , , , Nutrition, Serving:, 1, dosa, Calories:, 57, kcal, Carbohydrates:, 10, g, Protein:, 3, g, Fat:, 1, g, Saturated Fat:, 1, g, Polyunsaturated Fat:, 1, g, Monounsaturated Fat:, 1, g, Sodium:, 2, mg, Potassium:, 49, mg, Fiber:, 2, g, Sugar:, 1, g, Vitamin A:, 2, IU, Vitamin C:, 1, mg, Calcium:, 11, mg, Iron:, 1, mg, , , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Let us know in the comments below!, You may also like, Aval Upma, Rava Dosa (How to Make Restaurant-Style Rava Dosa), Bagara Baingan (Eggplant in Coconut Sauce), Paruppu Usili (South Indian Green Beans with Lentils), , , , 128, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , About, Vaishali, Hi!

        "Ragi Dosa": "Ingredients: , , , , 5, , How to Make Ragi Dosa with Step-by-step Photos, , , , , 6, , Notes, , , , , , , Ragi Dosa Recipe | How to Make Instant Ragi Dosa | Finger Millet Dosa | Ragi Dose, with, step-by-step photo and video recipe., South Indian cuisine offers a lot of varieties, including breakfast and, dosa recipes, . Dosa recipes can be prepared with almost any flour or grains., One popular, tasty, healthy dosa recipe is made with ragi flour or finger millet mixed with other flour to have a crisp dosa., , As I previously mentioned, the, recipe for ragi dosa, is very similar to the crisp, rava dosa, . I have taken the, rava dosa recipe, and replaced the maida ingredient with ragi flour or finger millet., The recipe is pretty much a restaurant-style and quite a popular one. The traditional finger millet, dosa recipe, is entirely different. In other words, it is prepared with, plain ragi flour, without adulteration. In addition, the recipe would follow the traditional dosa recipe with urad dal and overnight, fermentation, . Moreover, the texture and consistency would match a set dosa with a soft and porous texture. However, this is an instant recipe for crisp and thin texture., , , , , , , Furthermore, I would like to mention some easy tips and suggestions while preparing, instant ragi dosa recipes, ., Firstly, I added thick sour curd to this recipe, which helped to balance the taste with a hint of sourness. Alternatively, you can also add store-bought sour curd but may have to adjust the water quantity accordingly. Secondly, you can adjust the amount of rice flour as per your preference. Rice flour helps to give crispiness and is directly proportional to the amount of rice flour. Lastly, these dosas can be served as they are without any side compliments. Yet it tastes excellent with a choice of chutney recipes or sambar recipes., , Finally, I would like to highlight my other, Easy and Instant Dosa Recipe Collection, with this post on the, Instant Ragi Dosa recipe, ., It includes recipes like, oats dosa, , , wheat dosa, , , rava dosa, , , set dosa, , , instant dosa with cooked rice, , , curd dosa, , , masala dosa, and, bread dosa, .

Instant Ragi Dosa, commonly known as finger millet dosa, is known for its health benefits. In addition, millet-based dosa or recipes are also tagged as weight loss recipes due to their filling-in nature. Further, all millet-based recipes are naturally low in glycemic index and ideal for diabetes or cholesterol patients., , There are many different ways to make this Instant Ragi Dosa recipe, but the most common way is to make it instant. There is no planning, soaking, or fermentation in the instant recipe. However, it can also be made traditionally with soaking and grounding. Once the batter is prepared, it can be fermented and prepared as a soft or crisp dosa.

        "Soya Chunks Nutricious Dosa": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make high protein soya dosa with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , , high protein soya chunks nutri dosa recipe | meal maker dosa & chutney, with step by step photo and video recipe. morning breakfast makes one of the important meals in a day\u2019s routine. yet it can be tricky to prepare a healthy and tasty that attracts all the age group audience. the traditional breakfast recipes like dosa and idli do provide it, but can be monotonous. hence to make it more interesting i am combining the high protein soya with vegetables to make a healthy dosa recipe., , i have been getting a lot of requests lately for high protein recipes. this is a recent trend and i guess more and more people are inclined toward a healthy and nutrient-rich recipe. perhaps, on a normal day, i would not post this recipe with a video. there isn\u2019t any rocket science with this recipe, yet due to the popular request, i am posting this recipe with a video. i personally endorse this recipe due to its balanced supplements in it. we all know that soya chunks are rich in protein but the addition of rice flour and wheat flour, it makes carbs and fibre rich too. you may even add rava or semolina as a replacement to the wheat and rice flour, , , , , , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the, high protein soya dosa recipe, . firstly, i have used only soya chunks to prepare the nutri dosa batter, chickpeas, , pressure cooked lentils and kidney beans. secondly, the nutri dosa is filled with all the spices and flavours and hence you may not require any condiments or dips as a side with this recipe. yet i have prepared a seasonal raw mango chutney with this video which should make an ideal side dish. lastly, i have shaped it like a thick pancake to make it more attractive. however, the shape does not play any significant role and you may shape it like a traditional thin dosa., , finally, i request you to check my other related, breakfast recipes collection, with this post on, high protein soya dosa recipe, . it mainly includes my other related recipes like, masala pasta, , , how to make soft idli, , , suji ki puri, , , cooked rice dosa, , , tiffin sambar, , , saravana bhavana style poori kurma, , , oats omelette, , , maggi noodles, , , sabudana khichdi,

Karnataka-based recipes are generally known for their healthy breakfast variations. These are mostly made with rice and urad dal combination to make idli and dosa recipes. However, there are other simple roti-based recipes, and Akki roti is one such easy and simple breakfast recipe., , I, posted this, Akki roti recipe, long ago, when I started this blog. It is one of the most popular recipes among my readers. when I initially posted this recipe, I had posted without dill leaves or, sabbasige, but I did not have access to it then. Hence, I thought of revisiting this old post and posting it correctly. Moreover, I was getting several requests about the confusion of adding dill leaves. In my native, we do not add it, which is optional. However, adding these leaves elevates the taste and flavour of this recipe to the next level. Hence, I recommend adding it, even if you have not used it., , , Furthermore, I would also like to add more tips, suggestions and variations to the, Masala Akki rotti recipe, ., Firstly, I highly recommend using fine rice flour for this recipe. Do not use coarse rice flour, as you may be unable to shape it with tapping. Also, there might be cracks while roasting as they may not hold together. Secondly, dill leaves are mandatory for this recipe, but you may add other herbs like coriander and pudina leaves. Add as many fresh herbs as possible to make it more flavoured. Lastly, as we have added a lot of spices and herbs, it may be served as it is. But it tastes great when served with spicy chutney, garlic powder, and coconut chutney., , Finally, I request you to visit my other detailed, Breakfast Recipes Collections, with this post of, Akki Roti recipe, ., It mainly includes my other related recipes like, vermicelli pulao, , , roti sandwich, , , pinwheel sandwich, , , veg malai sandwich, , , tuppa dosa, , , dadpe pohe, , , rava dosa, , , nuchinunde, , , rava uttapam, , , pulihora, .

, ragi roti recipe | ragi rotti | nachni roti | finger millet roti, with step by step photo and video recipe. rotti recipes are very common across india, but millet based recipes are hugely popular with south indian. it is generally served for morning breakfast, but can be served for any meal. one such hugely popular and healthy south indian breakfast recipe is ragi roti recipe known for its taste and flavour., , millet based recipes are very common for our day to day breakfast. we generally make idli or dosa for weekend breakfast, but millet based recipes or even akki roti for weekdays breakfast. these are healthy but more importantly quick and easy to make in no time. moreover, last week i had shared 2 ways of making akki roti, and i got many requests to post, ragi rotti, recipe. my previous post of, finger millet roti, was very old anyway, hence i thought of posting it 2 ways \u2013 one patting the roti on tawa and the other with the help of banana leaves. i personally prefer to do the latter one, but some prepare to make these roti\u2019s in tawa too. hence i thought of sharing both the recipe., , , furthermore, before concluding some tips, suggestions and variations to, ragi roti recipe, . firstly, the dough has to be soft and easy to spread on any even surface. hence if your dough is hard and cannot be spread, you can sprinkle some water to make it moist and soft. secondly, i personally recommend using banana leaf to tap and spread the roti. you may use baking paper, silver foil and even cling wrap for the same purpose. also, attempt the tawa based approach if you have 2, tawa, , so that it can be used alternatively. lastly, the ragi roti is spiced with herbs and onions, hence you do not require any condiments specifically. yet you may very well serve it with choice of coconut chutney, or any chutney powder., , finally, i request you to check my other detailed, roti recipes collection, with this post of, ragi roti recipe, . it mainly includes my other
