        "Aloo Paneer Rava Roll": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make suji roll with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , suji roll recipe | suji ke roll | aloo paneer rava roll nasta | sooji ke roll, with step by step photo and video recipe. kids snack recipes are always controversial with a demand of taste and healthy perspective. having said that most of these snack recipes are oil-based or deep-fried and satisfying only the taste perspective. however, there are some snacks that satisfy both the conditions with no oil and made using steam and it is known as aloo paneer suji roll recipe., , lately, i have become a huge fan of roll recipes and particularly those recipes which are made with savoury stuffing and termed as a snack. these are not only healthy, but there is some curiosity about the stuffing and filling which makes it a perfect evening snack. last week i had shown, cabbage roll recipe, with minced soya chunks stuffing. this was hugely appreciated and many asked for more steam-based snack or roll recipe. hence continuing the practice i am posting another tasty and nutritious, suji ke roll, recipe. sooji or semolina based snacks are generally made either deep-fried or shallow, fried, , but i opted for the steam plus the tempering option., , , furthermore, i would also like to add some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the, suji roll recipe, . firstly, i would heavily recommend to use coarse, fine or thin sized semolina and avoid using bansi rava. fine powder helps to roll the snack, whereas you may not be able to roll with other types of rava. secondly, the stuffing is purely experimental and can be used with any type of combination of stuffing. i personally like both paneer and aloo based stuffing and hence used both. lastly, after the steaming, i have sliced and tempered it like, dhokla recipe, . this helps to add extra flavour and taste to the recipe but is completely optional and can be skipped if you do not wish to., , finally, i would like to add some more, snacks recipes collection, with this post of, suji roll recipe, . it mainly includes my other related recipes like, rava shankarpali, , , suji snacks, , , rava chakli, , , suji besan cutlet, , , suji ki kachori, , , rava dhokla, , , rava cutlet, , , suji pakora, , , aloo cutlet, , , cabbage roll, . further to these i would also like to add
