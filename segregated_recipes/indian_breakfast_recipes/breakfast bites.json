        "Idli Dhokla": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make idli dhokla with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , idli dhokla recipe | instant dhokla in idli stand | idli khaman, these 2 recipes can be integrated and clubbed together to form one recipe and idli dhokla recipe or idli khaman is one such variation., , i have posted quite a few variations of dhokla recipe, which includes the instant one without fermentation, authentic one with channa dal and fermentation and the semolina based, rava dhokla recipe, . however, this recipe is very unique with the combination of 2 different recipes from 2 different regions. in other words, i have just used the same batter of dhokla and steamed it in an idli stand. unlike the traditional dhokla recipe, where it is steamed in a large container, there is no hassle of cutting and shaping it later. it is already shaped like a small disc and can be served immediately without any issues. i personally like this recipe and i make it when i am bored with the rice and urad dal idli. it is instant, quick and more importantly healthy., , furthermore, i would like to add some more tips, suggestions and variations to, instant dhokla in idli stand, . firstly, while preparing the batter, i used curd or yoghurt in this recipe to have the sour taste. you may achieve the same by adding lemon juice or lime juice (2 tsp). secondly, if you do not have an idli stand you may use small steel cups to prepare the cup, idli dhokla recipe, . lastly, in this recipe, i have added eno fruit salt to hasten the fermentation process. eno fruit salt does not react with turmeric, whereas baking, soda, reacts with turmeric to result in pink colour. also, it would spoil the taste and hence it is better to use eno fruit salt., , finally, i request you to check my other detailed, idli recipes collection, with this post of, idli dhokla recipe, . it includes my other related recipes like, idli batter, , , vegetable idli, , , moong dal idli, , , kanchipuram idli, , , idli upma, , , instant stuffed idli, , , sabudana idli, , , bread idli, , , rava idli, , , semiya idli, . further to these i would also like to highlight my other

Also, grease the steel pan in which you will make the khaman with oil. I used one container from the stackable steel containers for the instant pot., After 15 minutes, add Eno to the batter and stir it gently in one direction.

I do not have a steam function on my duo plus.  So, what do I use in its place? Do I use the sterilization function or the manual pressure cook function?  Also, if I use either of those functions, do I vent or not vent, close the lid, and the time is still 15 minutes?  Thank you so much.

Once cooked, millet can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. Millet, unlike other grains, becomes solid and dry when cold and must be broken up and reheated before use., , Mustard Seeds :, , They are used as a seasoning rather than a base flavour in many Indian dishes, and they really perk up a lentil or rice dish when fried in a little oil with curry leaves . As a result, mustard seeds are excellent for adding flavour without adding fat to your diet., , Green Chilli\u00a0 :, , The green chillies in cooked or raw form give a fiery hot flavor.

        "Rice Pundi": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make pundi recipe with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , pundi recipe | rice dumplings recipe | mangalorean pundi recipe, with step by step photo and video recipe. udupi or mangalore cuisine is known for its healthy steamed breakfast recipes. most of these recipes are made using rice as its base and thus supplying the required carbohydrates. one such rice-based recipe is pundi recipe or rice dumplings made with idli rava and steamed in an idli stand., , i have posted quite a few udupi or mangalorean recipes till now, but some of them are nostalgic for me., pundi recipe, is one such recipe to me. during those days, pundi was made by grinding the soaked rice coarsely and then shaping it to steam. it uses to be a time-consuming recipe, but these days this recipe is made with idli rava to cut short the soaking and grounding procedure. i prefer the former way of making this recipe from scratch, but in this recipe post, i have shown the short cut way. my guess is most of my readers would prefer something quick and healthy breakfast recipe for early morning and hence used idli rava. perhaps i would post another recipe video starting from scratch., , , furthermore, some easy tips, suggestions and variations for a, tasty mangalorean pundi recipe, . firstly, if you prefer to make these dumplings using rice, you need to soak it and ground it to a coarse paste. in addition, once the rice is grounded you have to cook it over low flame stirring it continuously till it starts leaving the pan. the entire step is skipped with the idli rava. secondly, you can also make these using bombay, rava, or upma rava (, rava pundi, ) if you have concern over rice rava. lastly, serve these dumplings with choice of chutney or any coconut based curry. for meat eaters, you can serve with kori gasi or any spicy coconut based meat curry., , finally, i request you to check my other related, idli recipes collection, with this post of, pundi recipe, . it includes recipes like, , rava idli, , , masala pundi, , , oats idli, , , thatte idli, , , bread idli, , , sabudana idli, , , idli with idli rava, and, idli podi

Perhaps, one of the healthiest and cleanest foods which is full of multiple nutrients, and hence it is typically consumed by hardworking farmers. Ragi Mudde is typically consumed with thin rasam known as Bassaru, or Uppesru. It is typically prepared with a bunch of fresh leafy vegetables and from the decanted water, which remains after steaming lentils., , Honestly, I am not a big fan of the, R, agi Mudde Recipe, and I prepare this recipe only because of my husband. Even though he is not a big fan of it, he prefers to eat this once in a while, especially to lower body heat. According to him, the ragi balls as such does not have any taste and they taste good only with a good Saaru (rasam) or palya (curry). I agree with this point, and the side compliment plays a significant role when serving, finger millet balls, as a meal. I typically, prepare normal rasam with some garlic seasoning as a side dish, but any, coconut-based sambar recipe, should go well with this recipe. In addition, any spicy chicken or fish curries are also the best choice for meat lovers., , , , , , , Furthermore, some important tips and suggestions for a perfect, Ragi Mudde recipe., Firstly, always use a heavy-bottomed vessel to prepare and steam the, millet balls, . Otherwise, the finger millet may stick to the bottom and may not be easy to shape. In addition, always use a strong spatula or wooden stick to beat the ragi flour. A wooden-based, rolling pin, can be used to beat the flour as it carries the required strength and agility. Lastly, I heavily recommend using, ghee, instead of oil to beat the ragi flour as it would help with digestion. Ghee is preferred but not mandatory and you may use coconut oil or any cooking oil for the same purpose., , Finally, I would request you to check my other, Lunch Recipes Collection, with this post of, Ragi Mudde Recipe, .

Ragi Mudde is a popular choice in rural areas of South India and a staple food with farmers and daily wage workers. It is but an obvious choice for the fact that it has to offer a lot to workers. It provides all the required strength and nutrients required to keep the body and do the heavy lifting or physical work., , As such, the curry or rasam with which Ragi Mudde is served makes it a complete meal. And there can be myriad variations on how this curry is prepared and served together. Most commonly, it is served with Bassaru or Uppesaru made with a combination of leafy vegetables and lentil water. But the accompaniment option is limitless and can be served with any spicy gravy-based curries., , Video Recipe, , , Recipe Card for Ragi Mudde, , , , , , , , , Ragi Mudde Recipe | Ragi Balls | Finger Millet Balls | Ragi Sangati, , , HEBBARS KITCHEN, , , Easy Ragi Mudde Recipe | Ragi Balls | Finger Millet Balls | Ragi Sangati, , , 4.99, from, 201, votes, , , , , , , Email, , Tweet, , Share, , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , , Save Recipe, Saved!, , , , , , Prep Time, 5, minutes, , mins, Cook Time, 15, minutes, , mins, Total Time, 20, minutes, , mins, , , , , , , Course, lunch, Cuisine, Andhra Pradesh, karnataka, , , , , , Servings, 3, , Servings, Calories, 7, , kcal, , , , , , , 1x, 2x, 3x, \u25a2, 2, , cup, , water, \u25a2, \u00bc, , tsp, , salt, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , ghee, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , ragi flour / finger millet flour,  Instructions: , Firstly, in a small bowl take 2 tbsp ragi flour from 1 cup of flour.
