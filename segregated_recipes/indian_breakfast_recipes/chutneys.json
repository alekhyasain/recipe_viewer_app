        "Coconut Coriander Chutney": "Ingredients: , However, , Making this Green Coconut Chutney too, is super simple and just involves 2 main steps. First, , In addition to the fresh coriander leaves and coconut, ginger, roasted chana dal, lemon juice, sugar and salt., , The tempering consists of mustard seeds, split, husked black gram (urad dal), curry leaves and asafoetida (hing) fried in oil. You can use either fresh or frozen grated coconut for this recipe., , If you are having idli or dosa, then a chutney or dip made with fresh coconut is kind of must, particularly with these snacks. So, the Green Coconut Chutney is a good option. At times, I also serve this chutney with, Besan Chilla, made from gram flour (besan), onions and spices., , This Coriander Coconut Chutney has a raw herby taste of fresh coriander leaves (cilantro) which pairs brilliantly with the lovely earthiness of the coconut., , However, if you don\u2019t like the raw taste of coriander, , , , , , 3. In a blender jar, add 1 cup of the tightly packed coriander leaves and 1 cup grated coconut (fresh or frozen)., , , , 4. Next, add 2 tablespoons roasted chana dal, 1 inch chopped ginger and 1 chopped green chili (about 1 teaspoon, chopped)., , Skip adding roasted chana dal if you do not have them.

Lastly, add\u00a0\u00bd cup water or as required, depending on the consistency you prefer., , , , , You can make a thick chutney or a medium-consistency one, adding water as required. But do not make it thin as the taste and flavor gets diluted., , , , 8. Remove the chutney in a heatproof bowl like a steel or a Pyrex bowl. Taste the chutney and add more salt, sugar or lemon juice, if required. Stir and mix well., , , , Temper Green Coconut Chutney, , , , , 10. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small frying pan. Use any neutral flavored oil. Or you can also opt to use coconut oil or sesame oil (gingelly oil)., , , , 11. Keep the heat to low, add \u00bd teaspoon mustard seeds and \u00bd teaspoon urad dal (split and husked black gram)., , , , 12. Let the mustard seeds splutter and the urad dal get browned., , , , 13.

Serve the Green Coconut Chutney with South Indian snacks like idli, rava idli, masala dosa, medu vada, uttapam or Mysore bonda., , , , Expert Tips, , , If the coriander leaves that you are using for this chutney have tender stems, then do use them in this recipe. Or else, discard them., , The best consistency of this chutney is a thick or medium one. So, you can adjust the quantity of water accordingly. Also, , Avoid making a thin chutney as then you\u2019ll end up having diluted flavors. But you can make a thicker consistency if you like., , To make the chutney spicier, you can increase the number of green chillies., , Some flavor variations that you can make in this chutney are by adding 1 to 2 small to medium garlic cloves in it., , To make a sour chutney, you can add a small piece of tamarind in the recipe., , You can make the tempering in any neutral flavored oil, sesame oil (gingelly oil) or coconut oil as well., , , More South Indian Chutneys To Try!, Chutney Recipes, Tomato Chutney Recipe For Idli & Dosa, Chutney Recipes, Quick Onion Chutney Recipe (Vengaya Chutney), Chutney Recipes, Peanut Chutney Recipe | Groundnut Chutney, Chutney Recipes, Allam Pachadi | Ginger Chutney | Allam Chutney, , , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

        "Tomato Pachadi": "Ingredients: , Apart from balancing the tang from tomatoes, lentils and sesame seeds add some thickness and flavor to the pachadi. This is my Mom\u2019s recipe and she always used sesame seeds as they are healthy and are a rich source of iron, zinc, selenium, fiber and many more. If you don\u2019t want to use them replace with chana dal and/or urad dal., , Traditional tomato pachadi is made with heirloom tomatoes and usually no onions are used.

        "Green Chutney": "Ingredients: , The basic version of green chutney served in a lot of chaat places is made just with coriander leaves, ginger, green chilies, cumin powder, salt, lemon and chaat masala., , , As with any other recipes made with fresh herbs, this Green Chutney too tastes best on the same day. The fresh flavors begin to diminish as the chutney sits for longer at room temperature., , However if you prefer to make ahead and store it, make sure you transfer the chutney immediately to a glass container and refrigerate. Use up within 2 to 3 days. To refresh your chutney you may simply whisk the chutney with little Greek yogurt., , I know a lot of friends also freeze the green chutney in ice trays. Later transfer the chutney cubes to freezer safe container or zip-lock bags. For best results thaw the chutney in the refrigerator and optionally whisk a little Greek yogurt to enhance the color., , You may also refer to these similar, Chutney recipes, on the blog, Cilantro Chutney, Pudina chutney, Peanut chutney, Coconut chutney, , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Green Chutney (Stepwise Photos), , 1. Add 1 cup cleaned, rinsed and drained mint leaves to a grinder jar. Do not use stalks of the mint leaves as they are likely to make your chutney bitter., , , , 2. To the same jar, add 2 cups cleaned, rinsed and drained coriander leaves along with the following:, , , 1\u00bd to 2 tablespoons roasted chana dal (optional, fried gram or roasted peanuts or desiccated coconut), , 1 teaspoon roasted cumin seeds or \u00be teaspoon roasted cumin powder (Jeera), , \u00bc teaspoon salt (adjust to taste), , 1 to 1 \u00bd tablespoon lemon juice (adjust to taste), , 2 small garlic cloves (optional), , \u00bc to \u00bd\u00a0inch ginger (peeled), , 2 to 4 green chilies (serrano peppers, adjust to taste), , , , , 3. Pour little water and begin to blend. I used about 1 to 2 tbsps. If you do not use roasted chana dal you may not need to add water., , , , 4. Add more only if needed., , , , 5. Blend until smooth. Check salt & tang. Add more salt and lemon juice if required., , , , Serve green chutney with Indian snacks, chaats & sandwiches. Store it in a glass bottle and use up with in 2 to 3 days. You can also serve it with, Samosa, Aloo tikki, Veg cutlet, Bread rolls, , , , Pro Tips, , , To make the best green chutney full of flavors, make sure you use fresh mint or pudina & daniya (coriander leaves)., , Addition of 1 tbsps roasted peanuts or fried gram makes the chutney thick and binds it together. Also water does not separate from the green chutney., , You can skip garlic if you don\u2019t like the pungent flavor of raw garlic., , The ratio of mint : cilantro can be changed. I have mentioned the quantities that work good for me., , The color of the chutney may vary each time you make as the greens begin to oxidize quickly. This doesn\u2019t alter the taste though., , You can find the color of the hari chutney is different in each photo as they were shot at different times. So just ignore the color., , , , Related Recipes, , Pudina Chutney Re..., , , Peanut Chutney (G..., , , Idli Chutney (Dos..., , , Aloo Tikki Recipe, , , Veg Cutlet Recipe..., , , Bread Rolls (Pota..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Green Chutney Recipe, , , 4.99, from, 187, votes, , , , Green chutney is a chutney variety made with green chilies, cumin, coriander and mint leaves.

They also prevent the chutney from turning watery overtime. This helps to keep your chaats crisp for a little longer.

Yes you can use it for sandwiches and rolls as well. First apply butter and then the chutney else the sandwiches get soggy. You can check this, veg grilled sandwich, and, kathi rolls, to see how I make them. Kathi rolls with chutney become too soft in the box but still okay and good., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Maddie, , , , , , February 22, 2023 12:12 pm, , , , , , Delicious!

Rinse the cleaned coriander well in lot of water a few times., \u25a2, Pluck mint leaves and add them to a bowl of water. Avoid using the stalks as they taste bitter.

        "Dosa kurma": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make dosa kurma with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , dosa kurma recipe | kurma for dosa | instant kurma for idli & dosa, with step by step photo and video recipe. south indian breakfast recipes are typically served with different types of coconut or vegetable-based chutney or sambar recipes. yet there are other thick gravy based options which can also be served with these healthy steamed breakfast recipes. dosa kurma recipe is one such coconut based gravy option which tastes exceptionally great when served soft idli and dosa., , while some might be aware of this recipe, but some may wonder how different from the traditional, vegetable kurma recipe, . firstly, there is a subtle difference with its spice level and this recipe is considered to be less spice. the main reason being the curry is served for the morning breakfast which is always less in spice temperature. the other major difference is the consistency., kuruma for dosa, is always thin in consistency and thus can be served like sambar for dosa and idli. moreover, i have also introduced a significant to this recipe. i have used red chillies as an alternative to green chillies. this helps the curry to have bright red colour and making it more attractive and appetite when served with white coloured dosa and idli recipes. having said that it is not mandatory and green chillies can be used for this recipe., , , furthermore, i would also like to mention some tips, suggestions and variations for, dosa kurma recipe, . firstly, the kurma can be made with different types of finely chopped vegetables but do not overcrowd with too many veggies. ideally, potatoes, carrots, capsicum, beans, peas and sweet corn shells are perfect for this recipe. secondly, the gravy is not just limited to idli and dosa and can also be shared with flatbreads like roti and naan recipes. if you are planning to serve it for both, you may well increase the spice level so that it caters both. lastly, in this kurma, i have added fennel seeds or, saunf, which is the main ingredient for traditional ones. well, there isn\u2019t any harm if you skip these and hence you may skip if you wish too., , finally, i request you to check my other detailed, curry recipes collection, with this post of, dosa kurma recipe, . it mainly includes my other recipe variation like, lauki ki sabji, , , bendekai gojju, , , aloo bhindi, , , kaju paneer masala, , , white kurma, , , shahi paneer, , , beans ki sabji, , , aloo chole, , , baby potato fry, , ,

On occasions I have made this with others too and surprised how different they taste. So it is important to remember that each kind of bell pepper impart different flavor and color to your chutney., , Green capsicum is less sweet and a lot of times have a slight bitter undertones because they are the least ripe. Red peppers have a sweet flavor. Yellow and orange capsicum have a mild sweet, fruity and citrusy flavor. Whichever you choose, make sure you use a fresh capsicum that is firm and heavy for its size with a bright and glossy skin., , Also try using them up when they are fresh. Letting the green variety sit in refrigerator for too many days develops more bitter flavor and taste. I prefer to use onions or shallots   especially when using the green capsicum. Sauteed onions impart sweeter flavor and balance the bitter tones in the green bell pepper. Alternately you may use a tomato which also works the same way but it adds tang instead of sweet flavor., , , , The above picture is of the chutney I made with red capsicum using the same recipe. I also make this, Red Pepper Chutney, using peanuts and that tastes completely different from this one. You can also make this by roasting the bell peppers and onions in the oven or in the air fryer., , The below picture is of the coconut capsicum chutney, no onion is used in this version. I have the recipe of this as well in the recipe card below. If you are trying out this version, make sure you use lemon juice and avoid tamarind as it can alter the color and flavor., , , , More, Chutney recipes, Ginger chutney, Tomato chutney, Onion chutney, Coconut chutney, , , Photo Guide, , , 1.

Remove to a plate to cool down., \u25a2, Add oil to the pan. Saute onions, garlic and capsicum until soft and the raw smell of capsicums is gone completely.

Do you know anything about \u201cmango ginger (Mamidi Allam)\u201d?  It has got raw mango flavor and a strong ginger taste.  I remember back in the day, my mother used to make some sort of chutney using this mamidi allam, but I have no clue how she did or how it is done.  Here in US where I live, the Indian store guy sells fresh mamidi allam regularly.  He is not from Andhra and has no idea how it is used.  I am wondering if you know of any recipes using this product and if you do, please post them.

I will try making the chutney using mango ginger as given in your recipe 2.  You are right!  I remember now about mango ginger pickle.

I was trying to find one that approximates the one that my mom used to make and this was very close.  The first time I made it, I used my Vitamix (blender) and it required a lot of water to grind.  The taste was good but the consistency was off.  We ended up eating it with tortilla chips like salsa.  The second time, I used the Indian mixee and the consistency was just right.

Not sure why? But I never cook beets and carrots with water. I cover and cook them on a low flame so they cook in their own moisture. If needed I sprinkle some water. Yes do try with grated beets. For this recipe, I don\u2019t cook the beets fully. When they are partially cooked (slightly tender yet crunchy) I turn off the heat.

I have beeroots in my fridge \ud83d\ude42, Just a couple of questions, to be sure that I will cook what you prepared;, , 1. schould I use green chillis with or without seeds?, 2. I suppose, on account of the pics, that you used dried red chillis.. Is that true? My question is; with or without seeds?, 3. I get only dried curry leaves here. How much should I use?, , With best regards,, Sari, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Sari, , , , September 20, 2015 2:34 am, , , , , , Hi Sari,, you can make this chutney with green chilies alone or with red chilies alone or even a combination. Since my green chilies were not hot (not even mild hot), i used hot red chilies too. Using too many green chilies that are not hot may lend a different flavor. You can use with seeds any kind of chilies if they are not very hot. Using dried curry leaves may not lend that unique aroma, just skip them., Would love to hear how this turned out., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Sari, , , , , , Reply to, swasthi, , , , May 7, 2017 9:31 pm, , , , , , Sorry for my late reply\u2026 This recipe works always.

vegetable-based chutneys. having said that it tastes equally good without it and is not mandatory to add it. secondly, the recipe can be easily extended by adding other veggies like onions, tomatoes and, shallots, . if you are planning to add these make sure to saut\u00e9 it before grounding it. lastly, gajar ki chutney would last long for a week or 2 if prepared without coconut. you can easily refrigerate it in an airtight container and scoop only with the required amount of it., , finally, i do wish to highlight my other, chutney recipes collection, with this post of, carrot chutney recipe, . it includes recipes like, dahi chutney,, , coconut chutney, , , red chutney, , , green chutney, , , schezwan chutney, , , peanut chutney, , , mango chutney, and, ginger chutney recipe, .

The sauce tastes very good even without them. But if you are trying to replicate the store bought versions, use them. Hope your son loves the homemade sauce. Increase the amount of black pepper. If he prefers it spicier, try with a mix of hot and Kashmiri chilies.

Any red chillies with low heat are best for this recipe. But the actual authentic schezwan sauce made here in Singapore is with fresh red hot chillies. So I guess any chilies work but you have to keep adding more soya, sugar and vinegar to balance the heat levels. Some kind of dried chilies taste slightly bitter. Avoid them. I have never cooked  with those round dried chilies. I think you should experiment in small quantities and see.

heerekai chutney & raita, with step by step photo and video recipe. there are myriad vegetables we use on a day to basis and we end up making just one recipe out of it. however each and every part of these vegetables can be used to make different types of recipes and dishes. one such vegetable is ridge gourd and you can make curry, chutney and raita without wasting any part of it., , well last time when i posted the banana flower recipes, i had got a lot of requests to post similar recipes. basically, to use each and every part of a vegetable to make a complete meal. i have several vegetables in my mind but thought of starting the recipe with, ridge gourd, . the recipes you can make with, ridge gourd, are infinite, but i have selected the curry, chutney and raita (tambuli) as it makes most of the meal complete. the curry is typically served with rice but tastes great with chapati too. the chutney is again served as a side to rice, but you can serve to roti, chapati, idli & dosa. and finally, the raita is specifically made for rice but can be consumed as it is., , , furthermore, i would like to add some more tips, suggestions and variations to, ridge gourd recipe, . firstly, i would heavily recommend using a tender and fresh ridge gourd for this recipe. you can easily identify when you purchase it, by pressing it. it should not be soft and has to be slightly hard. secondly, you may not necessarily prepare all the recipes together in one go. you may stock the skin and seeds in, refrigerator, and use it in one or two days. lastly, the curry i have made curry using onions as i personally like it that way. however, you may skip it to make no onion, no garlic curry recipe., , finally, i request you to check my other detailed, curry recipes collection, with this post of, ridge gourd recipe, . it mainly includes my other detailed recipes like, kakarakaya pulusu, , , lauki ki sabji, , , bitter gourd stir fry, , , lauki kofta, , , bitter gourd curry, ,

        "Dahi Chutney": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make dahi chutney with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , dahi ki chatni recipe | dahi chutney recipe | dahi lahsun ki chutney, with step by step photo and video recipe. chutney recipes are an integral part of indian cuisine. be it south indian or north indian, the rajasthani dahi chutney recipe is a unique way of preparing the chutney due to the use of curd in it., , lately, i have started getting a lot of requests to post the red chutney recipe which i have been using as a prop in my other videos. basically, whenever i make a video on snack or breakfast i use this red coloured chatni as my side prop to dip the main dish. the main reason i use it is due to the fact that its bright red in colour with a smooth texture consistency. it easily gels with video frame and makes this dish appealing. i generally make it in bulk and store it in a large container and refrigerate it. be it for the recipe videos, or for may day to day breakfast, lunch or dinner, i use it frequently. particularly, the combination of, dahi chutney, with chapati is just heaven. you may also use it with dal rice combination too as a spicy side dish., , , furthermore, i would also add some more tips, suggestions and variations to, dahi ki chatni recipe, . firstly, i have added 10 kashmiri red, chillies, for this chatni recipe. it may sound a lot, but it is essential for this recipe. having said that, if you like to lower, you can reduce the number. secondly, while adding the yoghurt you need to whisk it properly to make a smooth textured paste. otherwise, it may curdle and you may not get the desired smooth consistency. lastly, while handling the chutney you need to use dry spoons and avoid any moisture contact. also, preserve it in a dry place for longer shelf life., , finally, i request you to check my other related, chutney recipes collection, with this post of, dahi ki chatni recipe, . it includes my other related recipes like, dahi chutney, , , garlic chutney, , , chana dal chutney, , , lahsun ki chatni, , , carrot chutney, , , tamatar ki chutney, , , pudina chutney, , , tomato

It tastes amazing!!, , Make sure you use good thick yogurt that isn\u2019t too sour. Runny yogurt is likely going to make your pudina chutney too runny. Some restaurants also add some fresh malai (cream) while blending to neutralize the tangy flavour and taste., , , , Photo Guide, , Recipe 1, , How to make Mint Chutney (stepwise photos \u2013 restaurant style), , 1. Pluck 1 cup mint leaves (tightly packed, 15 grams). We don\u2019t want to use stalks here. Add them to a bowl of water and rinse them very well a few times. Rinse half cup coriander leaves with tender stalks (tightly packed, 15 grams), a few times. Drain completely and add them to a grinder jar., , , , 2. Add \u00bc\u00a0inch ginger, 1 small garlic clove and 1 to 2 green chilies., , , , 3. Add \u00bd\u00a0teaspoon sugar and 1/3 teaspoon salt., , , , 4. Add 1 tablespoon chilled thick yogurt. Do not use runny yogurt. If you double or triple the recipe then add yogurt accordingly. Do not add too much yogurt at this stage., , , , 5. Grind until smooth. Do not over blend. Over blending may cause the mint leaves to release oils and can taste bitter. Keep this aside. If you want you can serve this as is or even refrigerate at this stage for later., , , , 6. Add the rest of the thick yogurt (1 cup minus 1 tbsp) to a bowl. Add \u00bd to \u00be teaspoon roasted cumin and \u00bd to \u00be teaspoon chaat masala. Skip chaat masala if you don\u2019t have. If you want you can reduce the quantity of yogurt but this is what we like at home., , , , 7. Whisk very well until smooth., , , , 8. Add the mint chutney to the yogurt., , , , 9. Mix well and taste test. Adjust salt and spice to taste. Serve mint chutney as a side., , , , Recipe 2, , South Indian Pudina chutney (recipe 2), , , , This version is spicy and vegan. Made in South Indian style with mint, coconut, green chilies, lentils or peanuts. Pudina chutney goes well with, idli, , , dosa, , uttapam, vada or Pongal. It is also a multipurpose version and can be served with anything, even as a side in your meal, can be used as a spread on your sandwiches, wraps or rolls., , Again South Indian pudina chutney is made in numerous ways. My mom would always add a handful of home-grown fresh mint leaves with most chutneys like, tomato chutney, , , peanut chutney, , mango chutney and even with, coconut chutney, . Most of her chutneys have either slightly saut\u00e9ed pudina or the fresh leaves., , This recipe is roughly adapted from one of her recipes. You can also add this chutney to curries or while cooking pulao., , , Photo Guide, , Recipe 2, , How to make Pudina Chutney (stepwise photos), , 1. Wash pudina in a pot filled with clean water. Repeat the wash a few times and drain them in a colander., , , , 2. Dry roast \u00be tbsp each of chana dal and urad dal on a low flame until golden. Add \u00bd tsp cumin to the hot pan and switch off. Cool these. If using bhuna chana skip roasting. You can also saute pudina in oil for 2 to 3 mins first and use. You can also use peanuts. Just roast the peanuts until aromatic and golden., , 3. Add \u00bd cup chopped coconut, 2 to 3 green chilies, \u00bd inch ginger or 2 small garlic cloves, pudina, roasted dal, cumin and salt. You can also add a tsp of tamarind paste if you like the tang., , , , 4. Blend them all together first for pudina chutney., , , , 5. Add water as needed and blend to a smooth or coarse chatni to suit your liking. I prefer to use lemon juice now. Transfer the pudina chutney to a serving bowl., , , , 6. Pudina chutney can be served without tempering too. To temper heat a small pan with little oil on a low flame. Add red chili, \u00bc tsp mustard and \u00bd tsp urad dal. When the dal turns golden, add hing and switch off the stove. Pour this to the chutney. Mix well., , , , Serve pudina chutney with south Indian breakfasts like, idli, dosa, evening snacks, , , , , Photo Guide, , Vegan Mint chutney (recipe 3), , Recipe 3, , This mint chutney is vegan and goes well with any snacks tikkis, cutlets, samosas & pakoras. You can also use this for your chaats like bhel puri, sev puri, pani puri etc., , If using for chaats you can also add a handful of coriander leaves. What I have shared in this post has no coriander leaves. I have shared another similar recipe of green chutney here which I follow if making the chutney exclusively for chaats., , But this recipe is an all-in-one which I use in so many ways as I mentioned above. To keep the pudina chutney thick I sometimes add a tbsp of fried gram or roasted gram or roasted peanuts., , These add texture and helps to keep the color slightly brighter.

This removes the raw smell of mint. For marination we don\u2019t make it with coconut and fried gram. A typical south indian pudina chutney is made this way.

But these are usually made with high amount of green chilies, garlic and tamarind. Eating in larger quantities can cause an issue for someone who is not used to these on a regular basis. But there are a lot of Telugu people who eat them regularly and still have no problem because they eat with plain white rice and ghee accompanied with rice and yogurt.

I also have a one pot, Methi pulao, here., , To quicken the process, you may pluck and clean the methi leaves the previous night and refrigerate. Prepare the tempering while the rice is cooking., , In the past, I would soak the rice the previous night and switch on the electric rice cooker with a timer set for the next morning. The rice would be done by the time I am ready to make this methi rice., , \u25a2, 1, , cup, , rice, , (uncooked or 3 cups cooked rice), \u25a2, 2, , tablespoon, , oil, , (or ghee), \u25a2, 1 to 2, , garlic cloves, , chopped finely, \u25a2, \u00bd, , teaspoon, , cumin seeds, \u25a2, 1 to 2, , green chili, , slit, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , green peas, , (frozen or preboiled), \u25a2, 1\u00bc, , cup, , methi leaves, , (tightly packed fenugreek leaves), \u25a2, \u00bc to \u00bd, , teaspoon, , garam masala, , or any spice powder (adjust to taste), \u25a2, \u215b, , teaspoon, , turmeric, , (or as needed), \u25a2, \u2153, , teaspoon, , salt, , (adjust to taste), \u25a2, 1 to 2, , tablespoons, , lemon juice, , (adjust to taste),  Instructions: , , , , , , Jump To Recipe, , , , , 7.2K, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , About Methi Rice, , Methi leaves known as fenugreek leaves are fragrant & slightly bitter tasting leafy greens, often used in Indian cooking to make lentil dishes, curries, parathas, snacks and even rice dishes., , , So you can make this in 2 ways. Use the precooked rice or make one pot dish., , , To make this methi rice, we prefer some green peas as they impart a mild sweet flavor. You may leave them out or substitute with some cashews., , More Methi Recipes, Thepla with Methi Leaves, Methi Dal, Methi Paneer, Methi Paratha, Aloo Methi Paratha, Aloo Methi Sabzi, , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Methi Rice (Stepwise photos), , Preparation, , You need 1 cup uncooked aged basmati rice or 3 cups cooked and cooled rice. Here is a quick way to cook rice. Add 1 cup rice to a slightly large pot and rinse well thrice. Pour 2 cups water., , Bring it to a rolling boil and turn down the heat. Cover and cook on a low heat until the rice is fully cooked. Most of the water is absorbed. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 mins. Fluff up with a fork., , Make Methi Rice, , 1. Pour 1 tablespoon oil to a hot pan. Add half teaspoon jeera, 1 to 2 chopped garlic cloves, 2 green cardamoms and slit green chili. If making for lunch box, use oil. Using ghee for lunch box sometimes make the rice hard., , , , 2. When the garlic is slightly fried, add 1\u00bc cup chopped methi leaves and \u00bd cup green peas., , , , 3. I forgot to add green chili at step 1 so used now. If making for kids, deseed and use. Saute on a medium flame until the leaves wilt completely. This takes approximately 3 to 4 minutes. I prefer not to over fry, so they retain the flavors and nutrients. However if you have digestion problems, fry them a little longer., , , , 4. Add 1 pinch of turmeric and \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon garam masala. Stir and switch off., , , , 5. Transfer 3 cups cooked and cooled rice. Rice should be grainy, perfectly cooked and not mushy. Sprinkle salt. If your rice is still hot, then add and set aside to cool.  Do not mix hot rice as it turns mushy. Mix it when the rice cools down a bit., , , , 6. Taste test and add more salt if you need. I prefer to sprinkle little lemon juice., , , , Serve methi rice with salad or curd., , , , , Related Recipes, , Thepla Recipe, , , Methi Dal Recipe ..., , , Methi Paratha Rec..., , , Aloo Methi | Pota..., , , Methi Paneer Reci..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Methi Rice Recipe (Methi Leaves Rice), , , 4.98, from, 38, votes, , , , A quick methi leaves recipe made with rice, fenugreek leaves, , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , For best results follow the step-by-step photos above the recipe card, , , , , , Prep Time, 10, minutes, , minutes, Cook Time, 20, minutes, , minutes, Total Time, 30, minutes, , minutes, , Servings, 2, , Author, Swasthi, , , , Stovetop Methi Rice, \u25a2, Wash and soak rice for about 20 minutes.

step photo and video recipe. chutney recipes are one of popular and sought after side dish recipes in india. in north india it is generally made and served as a side dish to snack or street food, but in south india it is served for morning breakfast. then there is a combination of these 2 and tomato pudina chutney recipe is one such easy and tasty chutney offerings., , well, to be honest, i am a big fan of just pudina chutney and tomato chutney prepared separately. i often make it for my snack side dish or for my morning breakfast respectively. having said that, this recipe the combination of both is unique and something to try. i am not a huge fan of this recipe anyway and i like to have the individual flavours. but there is huge fan following for it and my husband is one of them. he likes it as a side dish when served with dal rice or sambar rice combination. moreover, the best part of this recipe is shelf life. unlike other south indian chutney, i have not added coconut which improves the shelf life significantly. you may make it and preserve it in the fridge for 2-3 days easily., , , anyway, before wrapping up i would like to add few more tips, suggestions and variations to, tomato pudina chutney recipe, . firstly, in this recipe, i have not added coconut with pudina and tomatoes. many south indian may prefer to have additional coconut for extra flavour, but i think it would reduce the sharpness and flavour. secondly, i always recommend using fresh and ripe tomatoes for this recipe. you may use roma tomatoes for this recipe but can also use other available tomatoes. lastly, the chutney tastes better when tempered with mustard and urad dal with a hint of, hing, and red chillies., , finally, i request you to check my other, chutney recipes collection, with this post of, tomato pudina chutney recipe, . it mainly includes my other related recipes like, , sweet potato chutney, , , dry garlic chutney, , , chana dal chutney, , , methi chutney, , ,

        "Moonphali ki Chutney": "Ingredients: , , Ingredient notes, , Peanuts:, , I have used raw peanuts with skin and then roasted them before grinding. You can also buy roasted peanuts and then use them to save time. If you have skinned and roasted peanuts that will be fine too., Curry leaves, : Curry leaves are used to flavor almost every savory South Indian dish and I love this ingredient. If you can't find fresh curry leaves, use dried or frozen ones. However, the dried ones are not as flavorful as the fresh curry leaves. This ingredient completely transforms the flavor and aroma of a dish., Urad dal, : Urad dal is split and skinned black lentils. It is used to temper a lot of South Indian chutneys and other dishes. They add a nutty flavor as well as a crunch to the chutney, Tamarind:, I have used a piece of, seedless tamarind., You can also add, tamarind paste., Black mustard seeds:, It's also used to add a mild flavor and texture to the chutney. You can easily find it in the spice section of Indian grocery stores., Asafoetida, : Also known as, hing, in India, it's the resinous gum of a plant with a very strong flavor and aroma. So, never add more than around \u215b teaspoon of this spice to a dish. It not only adds a nice and unique flavor to the dish but also helps in digesting the food. Though naturally this ingredient is gluten-free, some brands add flour to it while processing. So, if you are on a gluten-free diet, make sure that the asafoetida that you are using is gluten-free., , , , How to make (step by step process)?, , , Step: 1:, Heat oil in a cooking pot and add peanuts. Roast for around 4-5 minutes or until the peanuts change color and become fragrant. Take them out in a bowl and allow reaching room temperature., , Step 2:, In the same pan add some roughly chopped onion and garlic. Saute until they start turning brown., , Step 3:, Add dried red chilies and cumin seeds. Saute for 2-3 minutes., , S, tep 4:, Add tamarind and saute for a minute., , , , Step: 5:, Add asafoetida and saute for a few seconds. It gets burned very past so don't overcook it., , Step 6:, Add salt, mix, and switch off the stove. Allow the mixture to reach room temperature., , Step 7:, Put roasted peanuts and onion mix in a grinding jar., , S, tep 8:, Add water., , , Step: 9:, Grind to make a paste. Transfer to a serving bowl., , Step 10:, Heat some more oil in a pan. Break dried red chilies into smaller pieces and add to the oil along with black mustard seeds, and urad dal. Saute until the urad dal starts turning brown., , Step 11:, Add curry leaves and saute for about a minute., , S, tep 12:, Pour the mixture over chutney and mix., , Your delicious and flavorful groundnut chutney is ready to be served!, , , , , How to serve?, , Peanut Chutney can be served at room temperature with almost every South Indian breakfast or a snack like Idli, dosa,, uttapam, , vada, or, paniyaram., , You can also spread it like peanut butter on a crisp toast., , , , How to store?, , Since peanuts have a natural oil that comes out when you grind them, you can easily store peanut chutney in an airtight container and then store it in the fridge for 5-6 days., , , , Can peanut chutney be frozen?, , Yes, you can also freeze peanut chutney in an ice tray and store it in the freezer for around 4 months., , Don\u2019t temper before freezing, just freeze the paste., , When you want to use it, take out the frozen chutney, thaw it and then allow reaching room temperature. If it's too thick, add some warm water and blend., , Temper with spices to get the fresh flavor., , , , Recipe tips and tricks, , Peanut chutney is made both with and without coconut. I prefer eating peanut chutney without coconut. If you want to make it with coconut just follow the recipe which I have shared and add around 4 tablespoons of freshly grated coconut to it while grinding the peanuts., Don't leave the peanuts unattended when roasting otherwise they will get burned and the chutney will turn bitter., Make sure that the tamarind that you are using is seedless., If your heat tolerance is low, add lesser red chilies or remove their seeds., Allow the mixture to reach room temperature before grinding., Don't add all the water in one go. Start with around \u00be cup of water. If the chutney is still too thick add more water and blend again., You can also add chana dal along with urad dal to temper the chutney., Non-vegans may add 1-2 tablespoons of thick yogurt to peanut chutney. It makes the chutney creamier., Some people prefer very smooth and thin peanut chutney and some prefer it slightly coarse. You can choose whichever way you prefer. The recipe will remain the same but for a smoother chutney add slightly more water and grind for a longer time., , , , Frequently asked questions, , Can store-bought roasted peanuts without skin be used to make peanut chutney?, , Yes, you can. It saves time and I use them too when I am in a hurry., , , Are curry leaves and bay leaves the same?, , No, they are not the same. Their taste and aroma are completely different and you cannot replace curry leaves with bay leaves in a recipe., , , , , , More easy South Indian recipes, , I love South Indian food. It\u2019s generally very light, nutritious, easy to make and full of flavors. If you also like South Indian food then the following easy South Indian recipes are worth trying:, , Lemon rice, Curd rice, Sambhar, Idli Podi, Cabbage Poriyal, Beetroot Poriyal, Kerala style pepper mushrooms, , , , More chutney recipes, , Looking for more chutney recipe ideas?
