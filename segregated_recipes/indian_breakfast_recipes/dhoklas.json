In a large bowl, add chickpeas flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and turmeric. Whisk well., Add the ginger paste, chili paste, yogurt, lemon juice and mix. Add water a few Tablespoons at a time to make a thick muffin type batter. (If using besan, you will need less water. If using store bought yogurt, you might need a bit more water). Grease a stoneware cake pan or bread pan. sprinkle the bottom with sesame seeds or coconut shreds., Pour the batter into the pan, Using a greased spatula or greased hand, press or shape the batter into the pan if needed. Cover the pan with foil lightly. Prick 1-2 small holes in the center of the foil., Bake for 15 to 17 minutes. Peak to check if the center is set. Remove from the oven and let sit for 5 minutes before removing foil. Invert onto a serving dish and slice/cube., Make the tempering:, In a small skillet, add oil and heat at medium. When the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them sizzle or sputter for a few seconds., Add the asafetida, chili and curry leaves. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until most of the chili is golden brown., Add the sugar, lemon juice, coconut flakes and the water. Mix and cook for 3 minutes or until the water is hot. Drizzle this over the dhoklas. Garnish with cilantro leaves and lemon juice. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. To refresh, microwave to warm up or serve at room temperature. Sprinkle hot water to moisten before serving., Serve with cilantro Chutney or serve as a side like cornbread. Add the tempering into the batter before baking to serve as a side., Steam instead of bake at step 4:, Use a steel steamer pan or bread pan. Place in the steamer and steam for 12 to 15 minutes. I use a pressure cooker to steam. The traditional dhokla that you get in restaurants is steamed., Microwave instead of bake at step 4:, Pour batter in a microwave safe bowl. Lightly cover and microwave for 2 minutes. check is done in the center. Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute longer as needed., , , Notes, For variation: Mix half of the tempering into the batter before baking., Tips: if the batter is too thin for any reason, add a Tbsp of rice flour or semolina to thicken. Besan might make thinner batter, so add more besan or rice flour., To sub non dairy yogurt, use full fat coconut milk or thick cashew milk. Use a bit less than 1/2 cup if using milk and bake longer (5 to 10 minutes)., , Nutritional values based on one serving, , Nutrition, Calories:, 249, kcal, , , Carbohydrates:, 33, g, , , Protein:, 11, g, , , Fat:, 7, g, , , Saturated Fat:, 1, g, , , Sodium:, 402, mg, , , Potassium:, 485, mg, , , Fiber:, 5, g, , , Sugar:, 8, g, , , Vitamin A:, 75, IU, , , Vitamin C:, 37.2, mg, , , Calcium:, 126, mg, , , Iron:, 2.8, mg, Nutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation., , , , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?

I used a lot more yoghurt, 500ml, because I had some to use up and I added peas, sweet corn and cauliflower leaves to the batter to increase the nutritional content and make it more of a single meal. Used an oiled metal cake tin On which I scattered pumpkin seeds as my son is allergic to sesame. Benefit of metal tin is that the Dhokla gets a golden crust plus the tin is easier to clean than stoneware which I\u2019ve used in the past.  Added cumin to the tempering and omitted the coconut. Served with coriander chutney.  Was delicious., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vegan Richa Support, , says:, , , , July 8, 2020 at 10:48 pm, , , , , wow!!

It may be that the baking soda or powder were old and some of the rising did not happen.
