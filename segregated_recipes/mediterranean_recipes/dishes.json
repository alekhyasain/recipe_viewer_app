Instructions: , , , , , , , , Nutrient values, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Slices of grilled brinjals interlaced with a creamy vegetable mixture and a tangy tomato sauce create a delightful combination of delicate flavours in this classic greek favourite., , To cut down on calories, I have used a low calorie white sauce made with a bottle gourd pur\u00e9e instead of using the usual white sauce., , The brinjal, , , , Disclaimer:, It is highly recommended that this recipe be relished by diabetics only occasionally and in small quantities. This is just a mere \u2018treat\u2019 and does not qualify for a regular diabetic menu., For the brinjal layer, Apply a little salt on the brinjal slices and keep aside for 10 minutes., Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and cook the brinjal slices, a few slices at a time, till both sides are golden brown. Keep aside., For the tomato sauce, Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water., Peel, cut into quarters and deseed the tomatoes., Chop finely and keep the tomato pulp aside., Heat the olive oil, add the bay leaves and peppercorns and saut\u00e9 for a few seconds., Add the onion, garlic and capsicum and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes., Add the tomato pulp (step 3) and allow it to simmer for 10 to 15 minutes until the sauce volume reduces a little., Add the tomato pur\u00e9e and salt and simmer for some more time., Finally add the oregano and mix well. Remove the capsicum, bay leaves and peppercorns and discard. Use as required., For the vegetable layer, Boil the bottle gourd in \u00bd cup of water until soft. Blend in a liquidiser to a smooth pur\u00e9e. (pressure cooking is also faster)., Heat the oil in a non-stick pan, add the garlic, green chilli and celery and saut\u00e9 for a few seconds., Add the yellow capsicum, red capsicum, green capsicum, mushrooms and wheat flour and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes., Add the prepared bottle gourd pur\u00e9e, milk, mixed herbs and salt and cook till the mixture is thick. Keep aside., How to proceed, Arrange half the cooked brinjal slices to form a layer on the base of 150 mm. (6\") diameter baking dish., Place the vegetable layer over the brinjal slices., Top with another layer of brinjal slices., Cover with the tomato sauce., Bake in a hot oven at 200\u00b0c (400\u00b0f) for 15 minutes., Serve hot., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Moussaka recipe with step by step photos, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Your Rating*, , , , , , \u2606, , , \u2606, , , \u2606, , , \u2606, , , \u2606, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Submit Reviews, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Madhus Cook Book, , March 13, 2025, midnight, , The taste is great but I have to make minor modification. This is a Greek recipe but as Indians, we are not used to eating just vegetables (without carbs, roti or rice or pasta). \nI substituted crushed red pepper instead of green chillis and zucchini for mushroom (this is my standard substitute for all recipes which use mushroom).\nUsed only 1/4 cup water to cook bottle gourd.\nThe picture showed cheese, though it was not in the recipe, I topped it with cheese. \nSince eating by itself is not possible, I made spaghetti and ate along with it since the taste resembled to that of eggplant parmesan.\nDefinitely a party recipe (have to double the quantity). It only serves 3 people made as one dish but when there are other dishes too, it can serve 4., , , , , , , , , Post Reply, , , , , 5, , , , , , , , , , , , , Tarla Dalal, , March 13, 2025, midnight, , Thanks for the feedback !!!

        "Vegan Moussaka with lentils": "Ingredients: , , Creamy, Cozy, Comforting Vegan Moussaka Recipe, , For years, Greek moussaka was a dish I had to order if it was on a menu. However, with fried eggplant, a meaty beef/lamb filling, and dairy bechamel topping, the traditional version is not even slightly vegan-friendly and sat heavy in my tummy. Luckily, it turns out it\u2019s fairly easy to make a vegan moussaka recipe that\u2019s every bit as decadent and delicious in a simple, healthier way., , This healthy moussaka combines roasted (rather than fried) eggplant and potatoes with a hearty tomato lentil \u2018meat\u2019 sauce and cornstarch-thickened creamy vegan bechamel. It\u2019s soy-free, nut-free, and made with only simple, , , Even better, it\u2019s fairly nutrient-packed, with the combination of lentils, potato, eggplant, and tomatoes supplying several vitamins & minerals, antioxidants, gut-friendly fiber, and plenty of plant-based protein. The result is a comforting, hearty, satisfying dish that\u2019s wonderfully indulgent and great for impressing family, friends, and guests at a mid-week meal or on special occasions., , Looking for more ways to enjoy budget-friendly, protein-dense lentils? Check out my comforting, lentil shepherd\u2019s pie, , hearty, vegan Bolognese, , and cozy, lentil stew, or, , lentil dal, . Or browse my list of, 24 Best Vegan Lentil Recipes, ., , , , The Eggplant Potato Topping:, , , Potatoes:, Use an all-purpose variety like Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes., , Eggplant:, Use medium-large eggplants free from brown or soft spots and heavy for their size. You may need an extra one, depending on their size., , Olive oil:, Or another neutral cooking oil, like avocado oil., , Sea salt & black pepper:, To season the veg., , Fresh herbs:, To garnish \u2013 like flat-leaf parsley or dill., , , , The Lentil Filling:, , , Lentils:, It\u2019s best to use canned (or home-cooked) green or brown lentils, as they hold their shape best when cooked for meatier consistency., , Olive oil:, Or another neutral cooking oil, like avocado oil., , Tomatoes:, This ragu-like sauce relies on both tomato passata and chopped tomatoes for richness, flavor, and texture., , Aromatics:, Combining yellow or white onion and garlic creates a flavor-packed base., , Seasonings:, A few simple pantry herbs and spices are all you need for heaps of flavor., , Bay leaves, , Dried thyme, , Oregano, , Paprika, , Cinnamon, , Sea salt & black pepper (or use soy sauce for extra umami flavor), , , , Sweetener:, I use a little coconut sugar (brown sugar will work, too) to balance the acidity of the tomatoes.

This will be on my regular recipe rotation, thank you so much.  I sliced a zucchini and a few carrots to roast with the eggplant and potatoes instead of adding an extra eggplant.  I also added a sprinkling of chopped roasted walnuts under the b\u00e9chamel for a little crunch.

I prepare and cook food quite slowly, so as other people noted, if you also cook at a leisurely place, it might take more time than you expect., , For next time, I would make a two changes:, 1. It might be sensible to make the b\u00e9chamel sauce first, as you need to give that 100% of your attention. Then you can put it aside and concentrate on the baking and saut\u00e9ing, and make sure everything else goes in the oven nice and hot. I also added lots of cheese and that made it even creamier., 2. I would double the aubergine, so. you can really taste them., , Thank you for this recipe!

It is what creates the vegan \"eggs,\" with its taste, consistency, and protein content. It is very different from wheat flour. Chickpea flour can be found in the baking section, bulk section, or health foods section of most grocery stores and is relatively inexpensive. You can also easily find it online!

        "Hummus Pizza with veggies": "Ingredients: they offer four different spreads:, , , hummus, , hummus with herbs (my favorite!), , lentil curry with quinoa, , kidney bean red bell pepper with quinoa, , , You can either just eat them with bread or veggie sticks or you could get a bit more creative and use them for pasta dishes.

        "Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread": "Ingredients: right?, , , , Follow me on Social Media, , Click on your most used social media icon below and follow me!, , , , , , , , , , CHANGE IT UP; MAKE IT YOUR OWN!, , Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you are stuck making your version the exact same way.  You can add any toppings you like to your flatbread.  You can even make one very large flatbread or two smaller ones like I made., , Most kids are picky eaters, so you might want to change up the black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta.  I\u2019ve used this same technique described in the recipe card and added just cheese and pepperoni on many occasions.  The recipe is very forgiving and completely adaptable., , If by chance you or your family cannot finish the flatbread \u2013 no worries!  Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread can be saved and reheated later.  Let the flatbread completely cool and then refrigerate.  When ready to reheat, wrap loosely in aluminum foil and bake for 5-7 minutes in a 350-degree preheated oven., , The aluminum foil should not touch the top of the pizza but should cover it.  This will prevent the toppings from burning, and will also prevent the cheese from sticking to the foil.  If you freeze the leftovers, allow the flatbread to thaw completely at room temperature before attempting to reheat., , , , , , , refer to the printable recipe card located near the bottom of this post., , , FOR THE DOUGH:, , , Active Dry Yeast, \u2013 Do not confuse this with Instant Yeast.  Active dry yeast needs to be dissolved in water before using, , Olive Oil, \u2013 You can also use vegetable, canola, avocado oil, etc., , Sugar, \u2013 This might seem odd, but the sugar makes for a tastier dough, plus, it gives the yeast something to feed on which promotes proofing or rising., , Flour, \u2013 I only ever used all-purpose unbleached flour in my dough.  I have not experimented with other flour options at this point., , Warm Water, \u2013 The water should be as close to 110 degrees F as possible.  Too hot and you will kill the yeast; too cold and it won\u2019t activate properly., , Salt, , , , , Lord Byron\u2019s Notes, , , , , , Do you have a question or comment?, Would you like to leave a review?, , Scroll down to the comment section and write me a message., , I will personally respond as soon as possible!, , , , FOR THE TOPPINGS:, , These toppings are just suggestions.  You can change it up and make a flatbread that suits your personal tastes., , , Mozzarella, \u2013 Use fresh mozzarella and slice it about 1/4 inch thick., , Sun Dried Tomatoes, \u2013 Use the ones packed in oil.  They have better flavour., , Black Olives, \u2013 I do not like olives at all, but I made this flatbread for John.e and he loves them.  You can use green or none at all if that\u2019s what pleases you., , Feta, \u2013 I love crumbled feta on flatbread, especially when it is a Mediterranean-inspired flatbread!, , Dried Herbs, \u2013 Basil and oregano are perfect on this one!, , Parsley, \u2013 Used for garnish and is optional., , Egg, \u2013 Beat with a little bit of water, this is used to brush the outside of the dough.

I have often purchased flatbread at the grocer and topped it with sauce, cheese, and our favourite toppings.  It\u2019s a great way to whip up dinner in a hurry.  And, it\u2019s a lot cheaper than pizza delivery!, , This recipe will work perfectly with focaccia, even though it\u2019s a very thick type of flatbread.  Naan works very well!  Roti will work well too, especially if you\u2019re looking for unleavened bread.  (Unleavened is a term that applies to breads that do not include an ingredient such as yeast which makes the bread rise and proof.  Most flat types of bread and unleavened breads.), , , , , , BLACK OLIVES, LORD BYRON??, , This particular Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread recipe was made specifically for John.e.  I had made up a double batch of the dough a little while ago and decided to make a, Traditional Newfoundland Pizza, for myself and McKenna.  I knew John.e wouldn\u2019t eat it, because Newfie pizza is a far cry from being vegetarian., , Armed with black olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and feta, I decided to make a Mediterranean-style flatbread for him.  If you\u2019ve been a reader of this blog for any serious amount of time, you would have known that this flatbread wasn\u2019t for me as soon as you looked at the photographs., , I refuse to eat black olives, but John.e loves them.  To date, there are over 500 recipes here at Lord Byron\u2019s Kitchen, and this is only the second recipe that features black olives.  My, Warm Farro Salad, has black olives in it too.  I can\u2019t make, all, , Fill a mixing bowl with hot tap water. This will temper the bowl which is important to yeast activation and growth. Measure out 3/4 cup of water that\u2019s 110 degrees F. Pour the water out of the bowl. Place one teaspoon of sugar into the bottom of the bowl and pour over the 3/4 cup of water. Sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water and let sit for two minutes., , Next, whisk in the olive oil. Add the flour, and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir the flour into the water and oil. Use your hand to knead the dough until it forms a smooth ball. Cover with a clean tea towel and set aside to rise. (Be sure to keep away from drafts or an open window.), , , , , , Now, the fun part! Let\u2019s assemble the flatbread!, , Once the dough is ready, preheat your oven to 500 degrees F, and lightly spray a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Using only half of the dough per sheet pan, place the dough onto the pan and use a rolling pin to roll it out into an oblong or rectangular shape., , Next, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough.  Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads. Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter., , Next, top each pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta. Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano. Bake for 10 minutes.\u00a0 Remove from the oven.\u00a0 Garnish with the chopped parsley, if you are using it, and slice the flatbread into wedges. Serve immediately.\u00a0 Enjoy!, , , , , , RECIPE TIPS & TRICKS, , The key to a really good flatbread is the dough.  You can use the dough recipe here and create any flavour of flatbread that you want.  I have made this same dough and spread sun-dried tomato pesto on it with some mozzarella and pepperoni for a make-at-home pizza.  I\u2019ve also mixed together equal parts butter and parmesan cheese with a clove of minced garlic and a little splash of olive oil.  Spread it over the dough and bake until bubbly.  You now have easy garlic fingers!  Be sure to dip them in my, Donair Sauce, !, , You can also make the dough ahead of time.  Once the dough has had time to rise, transfer it to a food-safe plastic bag.  Get as much air out of the bag as possible and place the dough in the refrigerator.  The dough will last in the fridge for 3-5 days.  Once you\u2019re ready to make your flatbread, , If you have any leftover flatbread, you can refrigerate it for 2-3 days and reheat it later.  You can microwave it, but be sure to do so on half speed/power, otherwise, the crust gets a little chewy.  You can also place the flatbread on a baking sheet and toss it in the oven.  Set the oven to 200 degrees F and let it go for 5 minutes., , , SERVING SUGGESTIONS, , If you follow my Homemade Mediterranean Flatbread recipe exactly as written, you might want to continue the theme if you are looking to feed a larger group of people.  I do this simply by adding side dishes that will complement the main.  In the case of this flatbread, I would serve it with this, Greek Potato Salad, or this, Cucumber Walnut Salad, or this, Fire Roasted Tomato and Artichoke Bean Salad, !, , , , , , , Do You Like This Recipe?, , You should consider trying these other delicious\u00a0recipes too!, , , , , , , , , Jalapeno Popper Flatbread, , , Unlike the popular popper which is usually stuffed and fried, For the Dough:, Fill a metal mixing bowl with hot tap water and set aside for a few minutes.  This will temper the bowl and help to ensure the yeast will properly activate.  While you\u2019re waiting for the bowl to warm, preheat the oven to 500 degrees \u2013 not broil, but degrees., Pour the hot water out of the bowl and wipe the bowl dry.  Add the warm tap water and the yeast.  Using a rubber spatula, gently stir the yeast into the water for no more than 5-10 seconds.  Set aside and let the yeast bubble and foam for at least 3 minutes., Sift together 2 cups of the flour, salt, and sugar., Add the olive oil to the yeast and water mixture.  Stir for a few seconds.  Pour in the entire flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed., Sprinkle your clean countertop with a little flour and empty the dough out.  Knead the dough together for 4-5 minutes until a dough ball is formed.  Place the dough back into the metal mixing bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and set the bowl on top of your preheating oven.  (Don't place the bowl on a burner, just on the surface of the oven.  The heat will help the dough to proof/rise.)  Let the dough sit for five minutes., For the Pizza:, Lightly spray two small baking sheets or pizza pans with non-stick cooking spray and set aside., When the dough is ready, lightly flour a flat surface, and using a floured rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a rectangular shape about the size of your pan.\u00a0 Place the dough onto the baking sheet and push the dough into the corners and up to the sides.  This does not need to be perfectly round or rectangular.  Just be sure the dough is evenly flattened. (Repeat with the other half of the dough on a second baking sheet or pizza pan.), Next, whisk the egg and the tablespoon of water together.  Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the perimeter of the dough., Evenly distribute the mozzarella over the two flatbreads.  Avoid placing cheese on the egg-washed perimeter., Next, top each pizza with the sun dried tomatoes, followed by the black olives, and then the feta., Sprinkle over the dried basil and dried oregano., Bake for 10 minutes.\u00a0 Remove from the oven.\u00a0 Garnish with the chopped parsley, if using, and slice into wedges.

I made this pizza dough twice in the past week.  One time I was in a hurry and left it for the 5 minutes.  The second time, I forgot about it and it sat for almost 20 minutes.

I\u2019ve been working on my dough skills and have had a lot of failures, so I used one medium to large cooking sheet instead.  I used all of the same toppings in the recipe except for the black olives \u2013 I only had Kalamata olives in the pantry, but it worked out because they added an extra saltiness (that I particularly love ) especially as there was not any direction to add salt \u2013 other than what is in the dough.  I have some ideas brewing for future topping combinations.  I can tell that this recipe was thoughtfully prepared and thoroughly tested!  I will be making more of Lory Byron\u2019s recipes very soon!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Designergal, , says, , , February 18, 2022 at 7:38 pm, , , , , , , I made the recipe for the actual flat bread with different toppings.  My toppings included a base of pizza mozzarella (minimal, and no sauce of any kind),stuffed queen olives quartered, marinated artichoke hearts coarsy chopped, diced fresh tomato, fresh minced garlic and fresh ground pepper. I added about 1 teaspoon of oregano to the flour before making the dough . I opted to bake the rolled dough on a pizza stone so it would be crispier. I heated the oven to 525 with the pizza stone inside . Once the oven was up to temperature I precooked the rolled out dough for 1 minute on the stone before removing and adding toppings. I cooked the flat bread for an additional 8 minutes once returned to the stone. It was so good! It was what I describe as a crispy cracker like pizza crust and this dough recipe will be my go to!

You could place it right in your oven, as long as the oven is not turned on.  My mom used to wrap the bowl in a tea towel and then a blanket that she kept for just proofing dough.

My grandmother always added the sugar to the yeast and water, so I did make that small adjustment. Using my KitchenAid mixer to do the kneading, I was able to triple the recipe.  I pre-bake my crusts on parchment paper for 6-7 minutes in a 450 degree oven on the middle rack. After baking, I take them off the parchment paper to cool on a baking rack and once cool, I freeze them so that we always have pizza crusts on hand., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Jan, , says, , , September 9, 2023 at 7:16 pm, , , , Hi, how long did you knead in the mixer, and at what speed?

All opinions on this blog are my own., , Some of my best memories are of Christmas mornings. My sisters and I would have to stay in bed till at least 7am \u2013 my parent\u2019s rule. The anticipation was almost too hard to stand. We couldn\u2019t wait to tear out of bed to see what was under the Christmas tree. We\u2019d anxiously watch the clock until the numbers hit 7:00 and then run excitedly to wake up our parents to start the festivities., , Though we could look to see what Santa brought, we\u2019d have to wait a bit longer for my parents to grab themselves a coffee and my mom to pop breakfast in the oven. While it was baking, we had to pose for photos in front of the tree. Looking back at those photos, I can see the excitement gleaming from our eyes., , Christmas breakfasts typically were overnight breakfast casseroles. My mom loved their simplicity of preparing everything the night before. The only task you had to do the day of is bake and eat. Mind you, back then I didn\u2019t appreciate her efforts.

I guess there is still a child in me somewhere., , , , Mediterranean Brunch Bake, , I did follow my mom\u2019s footsteps and go with a breakfast/brunch casserole for Christmas day.
