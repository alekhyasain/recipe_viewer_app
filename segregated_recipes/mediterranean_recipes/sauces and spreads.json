It\u2019s ready in less than 15 minutes!, , , , Tahini is a paste made from sesame seeds, . It is a staple in many cuisines, especially in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It\u2019s vegan, gluten-free, tastes nutty, and is incredibly simple to make., , Store-bought jars of tahini can be expensive. Homemade tahini is not only cheaper, but it also tastes amazing. Use tahini to make, homemade hummus, ,, tahini dressing, ,, tahini sauce, , and more!, , , , , Sesame seeds:, I use hulled seeds (pictured below on the left) and toast them in a dry skillet to bring out their natural nuttiness., , Oil:, I add a few tablespoons of neutral-flavored oil to help the tahini turn into a creamy smooth paste. Try avocado oil, extra-virgin olive oil, or vegetable oil. Sesame oil (not toasted sesame oil) also works., , Salt:, Optional, but I always use it. It just makes the tahini taste better., , , How to Make Homemade Tahini, , Tahini is incredibly simple to make. You will, grind sesame seeds in a food processor with some oil until smooth., If you\u2019ve ever made nut butter like, almond butter, or, homemade peanut butter, , the process is very similar., , , Toasted sesame seeds make our tahini taste even better!, Toast them in a dry skillet over medium-low heat, stirring often and watching them closely until they turn golden., , Toss your toasted seeds into the food processor, . Process until they form a crumbly paste. A powerful food processor helps, but most standard ones will work, too. (I\u2019ve included tips for using a blender below the recipe.) It\u2019s going to go through a few stages. First, the seeds break down into a crumbly mixture that honestly doesn\u2019t really look like it\u2019s going to turn into tahini. Then, it eventually breaks down even more and becomes the creamy tahini we are looking for., , , Adding a few tablespoons of mild-tasting oil is helpful., This helps the tahini become more smooth, creamy, and drippy. You can use less oil, but the tahini won\u2019t be as easy to pour. I find 3 to 4 tablespoons perfect for a texture like store-bought tahini. Process a bit more, scraping down the bowl as needed, and your tahini is now ready to use!, , Ways\u00a0to Use Tahini, , The most well-known way to use tahini is to, make hummus, , but we use it in our kitchen in many other ways. We use tahini to make other dips like, baba ganoush, (a roasted eggplant dip) and serve it plain next to, homemade falafel, ., , It\u2019s also the perfect base for sauces and dressings. Look at our, tahini salad dressing, or this, creamy tahini sauce, with lemon and garlic. I also use that creamy sauce for this, tahini kale salad, , a dip for our, garlic asparagus, , these, chicken lettuce wraps, , and a drizzle for, honey roasted\u00a0carrots, ., , You can even use tahini for desserts. Seriously. Drizzle over ice cream or use it instead of peanut butter or butter in your favorite cookies. Once you have tahini in your fridge (it lasts over a month), we bet you will find yourself adding it to a variety of dishes without direction from us!, , , , , , Easy Tahini, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 5.0 (94 reviews), , , , , , , , , Leave a review, , , , , , , Save, , , , Pin, , , , Email, , , , Print, , , , , , , PREP, , 10mins, , , , COOK, , 5mins, , , , TOTAL, , 15mins, , , , , Making tahini at home is easy and cheaper than buying it from the store. I also think it tastes better! For the best deals, look for sesame seeds in bulk bins or at International, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets., , While you can make tahini from unhulled, sprouted, or hulled sesame seeds, we prefer hulled seeds., , , Makes approximately 1/2 Cup, , , Watch Us Make the Recipe, , , , , You Will Need, , 1 cup (140g) sesame seeds, we prefer hulled, , 2 to 4 tablespoons neutral flavored oil such as avocado,\u00a0 grape seed, vegetable or a light olive oil, , Pinch of salt, optional, , , ,  Instructions: , , 1, Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly, until the seeds become fragrant and turn light golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stay close and keep stirring, as the seeds can burn quickly., , 2, Add the toasted sesame seeds to the bowl of a food processor, then process until a crumbly paste, about 1 minute., , 3, Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of the food processor a couple of times., , 4, Check the tahini\u2019s consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty, and should be pourable. You may need to process for another minute and add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil., , 5, Taste the tahini for seasoning, then add salt to taste. Process 5 to 10 seconds to mix., , 6, Store tahini in an airtight container in the fridge for one month., , , , , , , Adam and Joanne's Tips, , , Storing:, Keep tahini in an airtight jar in the refrigerator for a month. After some time in the fridge, it might separate like natural peanut butter. To fix this, stir it well before using it., , Sprouted and black sesame seeds:, You can make tahini from sprouted or black sesame seeds. If you have sprouted your seeds at home, make sure that you dry and toast them before making the tahini., , Unhulled sesame seeds:, Tahini made from unhulled sesame seeds tastes more bitter and isn\u2019t as smooth as when made from hulled seeds. I recommend using hulled seeds., , Sesame seeds not processing:, The sesame seeds take a minute or two to start breaking down (watch our video for reference). If your seeds are whirling around your processor bowl, you may need a higher-powered processor, or the blade may be sitting above the seeds. If you think this is the case, try increasing the sesame seeds in the bowl., , Blender:, I prefer using my food processor, but if you have a high-powered blender, you should be able to make tahini.

It is a popular dish in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. You can find it in most grocery stores, but trust me, you\u2019ll want to skip those and make your own. Homemade hummus is just so much better!, , This hummus recipe is a keeper, (our family\u2019s been making it for years!). So many of our readers swear it\u2019s their forever hummus recipe, too. I\u2019ve also shared our recipe for, roasted red pepper hummus, , which I bet you\u2019ll also love!, , , , Chickpeas (or garbanzo beans):, These are the base for my hummus, and they can be canned or cooked from scratch. I use both, but homemade chickpeas have a slightly better flavor., , Tahini:, This sesame seed paste makes the hummus so delicious. You can buy it at the store or make your own. I prefer homemade because it makes my hummus 100% from scratch. Here\u2019s my, homemade tahini recipe, . To make hummus without tahini, see my tips below the recipe., , Lemon juice:, Skip the bottled stuff! Fresh lemon juice makes all the difference in great hummus., , Garlic:, I use one small clove for just the right amount of flavor, but you can add more for a stronger garlic flavor or use roasted garlic instead. Here\u2019s, how to roast garlic, ., , Ground cumin and salt:, Both improve the flavor of our hummus, and the cumin adds a little extra richness and spice. In our video, I sprinkle Za\u2019atar seasoning on top for serving, which I love!, , Olive oil:, This gives my hummus a luxuriously smooth texture. I also like to drizzle a little extra on top when serving. Fruity, light-flavored olive oils are my favorite for making hummus., , , How to Make Hummus from Scratch, , Seriously, this simple trick makes a huge difference., , Tahini and lemon juice go in first. Then, before you add anything else, turn on the food processor and let it run for a minute or two. See the photos\u00a0below?\u00a0In the first photo,\u00a0I\u2019m pouring tahini into a clean food processor., , , After a minute of being whirled, whipped, and creamed in the food processor, it turns into the paste you see in the next photo. It\u2019s lighter in color and much thicker., , , Now, processing the first batch for a minute before adding the rest. Then, I stand back and let my food processor run., , When it looks close to done, I add a splash of cold water while the processor is still running. After a few tablespoons of water, the mixture transforms into, fluffy, creamy, whipped hummus., , I use cold water, but aquafaba (chickpea liquid) works incredibly well, too. If you want to learn more about it, here\u2019s our, ultimate guide to aquafaba, . Some of our readers have also suggested using ice cubes instead of the water., , , Do You Need to Peel the Chickpeas for Hummus?, , I usually skip peeling my chickpeas when making hummus, but it\u2019s totally up to you! If you have some extra time and want the absolute smoothest texture, go ahead and peel them. It takes about 10 minutes to peel a can, and it does make a subtle difference. The photo below shows slightly smoother hummus made with peeled chickpeas on the left., , Even though the peeled chickpeas make a slightly smoother hummus, the difference isn\u2019t huge. So, if you\u2019re short on time, skip peeling. Your hummus will still be delicious! For more recipes with chickpeas, see all of our, chickpea recipes, ., , , What to Serve with Hummus, , There are so many delicious ways to enjoy hummus! I love dipping, fluffy flatbread, , , homemade pita bread, , or fresh, crunchy veggies in it. It\u2019s also delicious, next to other spreads and dips, like my homemade, baba ganoush, (a roasted eggplant dip), , tzatziki sauce, , , homemade labneh, , and our incredible, tahini sauce, . For extra flavor, try adding some toppings, as I do for my, spiced beef and feta hummus, ., , Hummus is also great on sandwiches and wraps, alongside, homemade falafel, , or as a healthy, flavorful filling for, lettuce wraps, .

You will need tahini, a paste made from sesame seeds. Buy it or make it yourself. Here\u2019s our, homemade tahini recipe, , which I highly recommend for the best homemade hummus! To leave it out, add more olive oil., , , 6 Servings (Makes 1 1/2 cups), , , Watch Us Make the Recipe, , , , , You Will Need, , 1 (15oz) can chickpeas, drained or 1 \u00bd cups (250g) cooked chickpeas, , 1/4 cup (60ml) fresh lemon juice, 1 large lemon, , 1/4 cup (60ml) well-stirred tahini, try our, homemade tahini recipe, , 1 small garlic clove, minced, , 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving, , 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, , Salt to taste, , 2 to 3 tablespoons (45ml) cold water or aquafaba, , Dash ground paprika, sumac, or Za\u2019atar for serving, , , ,  Instructions: , , 1, In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then process for 30 seconds more. This extra time helps \u201cwhip\u201d or \u201ccream\u201d the tahini, making the hummus smooth and creamy., , 2, Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, and then process for another 30 seconds or until well blended., , 3, Drain the chickpeas. Then add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the remaining chickpeas and process them until thick and relatively smooth, 1 to 2 minutes., , 4, The hummus will likely be too thick and still have tiny bits of chickpea. To fix this, slowly add 2 to 3 tablespoons of cold water or aquafaba with the food processor turned on until you reach the perfect consistency., , 5, Taste and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika, sumac, or Za\u2019atar., , 6, Store homemade hummus in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to one week. Freeze, covered with a thin layer of olive oil, for up to one month., , , , , , , Adam and Joanne's Tips, , , How to cook dried chickpeas:, Use canned or home-cooked chickpeas for this recipe. Here is, how we cook dried chickpeas, ., , Hummus without tahini:, For the best hummus, which rivals our favorite store brands, use tahini.\u00a0However, a chickpea puree without it is still quite delicious. Just add more olive oil. Another option is to use natural, unsweetened, creamy peanut butter in its place., , If you like garlicky hummus, , increase the garlic by a clove or use, roasted garlic, ., , Aquafaba for fluffy hummus:, This is the thick starchy liquid in a can of beans (or the bean cooking liquid). You can use this instead of water in the last step of the recipe. Instead of plain water, add a splash of aquafaba at the end. As it whips, it creates an incredibly light and airy texture. Taste your aquafaba first. If it\u2019s too salty, use less salt when making your hummus., , Tahini & lemon juice are not creaming:, Depending on your food processor, the blade might not come into contact with the tahini and lemon juice. You need to increase the amount of liquid in the food processor, so add the olive oil. If they still do not cream, add a tablespoon of cold water., , Blender:, A food processor is best for making hummus, but a high-powered blender will work.

I have always made the \"Moosewood\" cookbook recipe before and never tried adding any flavors so this is definitely a game changer.  I put a few too many garlic cloves in mine, five was just too much, and I think I would have preferred to use just slightly less cumin.  Also, there was a technique I ran across once upon a time to lighten the tahini first by mixing it up with a little hot water until it was creamier (and was there also a pinch of baking soda involved?  I will have to look back at my notes somewhere...) which I think would have given a lighter texture overall, which in turn might have allowed the roasted red pepper flavor to be more pronounced.  I will definitely try this recipe again.

I always thought tzatziki would be difficult, so I suffered through mass-produced brands I\u2019d find in the store. Never again! Thank you so much!, , Note, I made a few substitutions, based on availability and time:, , Oatly plain yogurt \u2014 a little thin for this recipe, next time I\u2019ll make sure I use a true Greek style product, if I don\u2019t make the coconut base., , Garlic powder instead of fresh minced garlic \u2014 I went low, I\u2019ll seriously increase the amount next time if I\u2019m not using the real stuff., , Cucumber \u2014 not a sub, but a suggestion to follow the recipe and make sure you squeeze out as much water as possible. I probably should have done it longer/harder, the thinness of the final product was probably due in part to excess moisture from the cucumber., , Salt & pepper \u2014 I added more than a pinch, but we like salty/peppery/savory food in our house.

And forgiving: I didn\u2019t have cucumber but went ahead without as this sounded amazing to make with a meal featuring the better-than-restaurant falafel (also amazing), and it was delicious. I used dairy yogurt as I\u2019m not vegan and dried dill as I didn\u2019t have fresh.

Before becoming vegan, I loved Tzatziki but hadn\u2019t tried \u201cveganizing\u201d it myself. Your recipe is a great base (your recipes rarely disappoint). I used Cocojune coconut yogurt & had no fresh dill, so used dried. I think that was the only downfall, because the dry was a little too bitter. Next time I\u2019ll plan for it & have fresh dill as your recipe says. I added more lemon & more cucumber to cut the bitterness & thought it was great.

I have tried a couple others, but nothing compares!, , A couple things I have modified:, 1 \u2013 I use Kite Hill Greek Style yogurt, it has the thicker consistency I like and then I don\u2019t have to make my own from scratch. Usually I can only find this at Whole Foods, and let\u2019s be honest, entering that place is DANGEROUS for your wallet! I have made this with regular almond based  yogurt, but I let the water drain through a cheesecloth overnight before I  use it!, , 2 \u2013 After I mince the garlic, I put it on a small frying pan and heat it for a few mins before I mix it into the recipe. I do this because I meal prep for the whole week, and I found that by the end of the week this recipe had way too much of a kick to it with that fresh garlic. Putting it on the pan first seems to tone down the strength of the garlic so it doesn\u2019t become overpowering. If you plan on eating most of this recipe within a couple days, you probably don\u2019t have to do this., , After I transitioned to a plant based diet, the #1 thing I missed was tzatziki!!

I ran my cucumber through the juicer, which gave me perfectly chopped up and strained cucumber bits. I drank the juice. I couldn\u2019t find any plain coconut milk greek yogurt even at Whole Foods, so I used kite hill almond Greek and it turned out awesome!
