Thank you for your support., , , Inspired by our trip to Israel, I created a easy baked falafel recipe that is just as easy as it is tasty! It\u2019s made with canned chickpeas so there\u2019s no soaking necessary. These protein-packed patties are great for topping bowls and salads, plus they\u2019re vegan and gluten-free., , , Ever since our trip to Israel last November, I\u2019ve been hooked on Israeli food. Not only does it take me back to that time and place, but it\u2019s just so fresh and the flavors used in their cooking are incredible. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get sick of Middle Eastern food. I just stumbled across, this article by Food52, that says \u201cthe U.S. appetite for goods and products from (Middle Eastern countries) is on the rise.\u201d Apparently I\u2019m on trend\u2026 totally not mad about it., , , Rather than just daydreaming about these flavors or depending on a local restaurant, I decided I needed to create my own recipe for baked falafel., , , The main reason these falafel are so easy is that I used canned chickpeas. Traditionally, falafel is made using dried chickpeas that have been soaked overnight. No, soaking is not hard, but sometimes I forget to start the process the night before and when mama wants falafel, mama wants falafel. \ud83d\ude09 I typically like to keep my pantry stocked with a variety of spices, Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Spray a baking sheet with oil., Add chickpeas, onion, garlic, oil, parsley, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, salt and cayenne into a food processor and pulse until just combined. You don\u2019t want to over-process the mixture or you\u2019ll end up with hummus. Plus, having a few chunks of chickpeas gives the falafel a nice texture. Stir in baking soda and oat flour. At this point your mixture should be holding together quite well., Scoop spoonfuls of mixture out and form into small patties; you should get about 15. Place on prepped baking sheet., Bake 10-12 minutes, flip patties and bake for another 10-12 minutes or until falafel are golden and cooked through., , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark, , Video, , , , , , , , , , , Nutrition, Serving:, 3, falafel, |, Calories:, 143, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 24, g, |, Protein:, 6, g, |, Fat:, 5, g, |, Sodium:, 648, mg, |, Fiber:, 6, g, |, Sugar:, 1, g, , Nutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation., , , , Additional Info, , Course:, Lunch/Dinner, Cuisine:, Middle Eastern, Keyword:, baked falafel, easy baked falafel, , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, Mention, @eatingbirdfood, and tag, #eatingbirdfood, !, Share:, Pin, Facebook, Tweet, Yummly, Email, , Dinner, , Gluten-Free, , Recipe, , Vegan, , Vegetarian, , Vegetarian Mains, , , Related Posts, , , GF, Gluten-Free, DF, Dairy Free, V, Vegan, VG, Vegetarian, Vegan Lentil Loaf (Vegan Meatloaf), GF, Gluten-Free, DF, Dairy Free, Slow Cooker Chicken Wild Rice Soup, GF, Gluten-Free, VG, Vegetarian, LC, Low Carb, Cauliflower Pizza Crust, GF, Gluten-Free, DF, Dairy Free, P, Paleo, LC, Low Carb, HP, High-Protein, Egg Roll in a Bowl, , About Brittany, Hey there, I\u2019m Brittany, the creator of Eating Bird Food, , cookbook author, , health coach and mama of two littles.

        "Vegan easy falafel": "Ingredients: this vegan and gluten free Mediterranean snack is such a treat., , , While these are traditionally fried, you can easily bake them too. Serve falafels with, hummus, , , thahini, sauce as snack or stuff in your pita along with your fav salad for a hearty meal. What\u2019s your favorite way to eat these?, , I first tasted falafel in our Bangalore days. It was a part of an amazing mezze spread and I have been a loyal fan ever since \ud83d\ude42, , It is close to our very own, masala vada, , but only in texture. They both are poll apart in flavors and unique on their own., , This recipe is an authentic recipe to make falafel, that I picked up from a middle eastern cook book long back. Over the years I have made it so many times and it is such a staple at our home., , I bake our own pita and it is such a fun to put together a pita sandwich with falafel, hummus and a quick salad., , So if you are fan of this middle eastern eastern but haven\u2019t tried your hands at this, do make some and you will totally enjoy the homemade ones., , What Is Falafel?, , , Vegan and gluten free by nature, this is a very popular snack worldwide especially with vegetarians., , It is believed that falafel originated in Egypt and was consumed Coptic Christians during religious holidays like lent as meat replacement. In Egypt falafel is made with fava beans., , When I first tasted this snack, I was amazed by its flavor and crispy texture. I was determined to nail the recipe so that I can enjoy falafel whenever I want \ud83d\ude42, , blend or pulse with herbs and seasoning, make ball and fry., , This is what I call my kind of cooking, straight forward and easy steps with an incredible dish that you cannot get enough of \ud83d\ude42, , Whether you serve as a snack or as meal with pita this falafel is something that you will be so pleased with!, , This Falafel Recipe Is, , Traditional & authentic, , Absolutely delicious, flavorful and crispy, , ridiculously easy to make, , wholesome snack for kids, , vegan & gluten free, , full of plant protein, , , What Are Falafels Made Of?, , Before getting into the recipe, , Chickpeas, \u2013 the star of our dish. We need white chickpeas or kabuli chana or garbanzo beans for this. Get dried chickpeas and soak overnight for best results. I absolutely don\u2019t recommend canned chickpeas for falafel. read more on this in tips section., , Onions & garlic, \u2013 For flavor and texture, use as much as you prefer., , Herbs-, Two important herbs for making authentic and traditional falafel are cilantro leaves and parsley. ou can leave out either one if you don\u2019t have. You can also add dill leaves., , Spices-, roasted cumin, coriander and fresh pepper powder. You can also add a dash of chili powder for more heat., , , , flour for binding, \u2013 if your mixture is made in rightly you do not need any flour for binding. Adding flour definitely alters the texture of this snack and makes them dense. However if your falafel mixture doesn\u2019t hold shape, you can add 2 tablespoons of rice flour or chickpea flour and bind well., , Baking powder or soda, \u2013 the common thought is that adding baking soda lends an airy and light texture to falafel. Again, this can be achieved by using well soaked chickpeas and frying in right temperature. If you want to bake the falafels do add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda though., , , Some Tips Before We Begin, , Use dry chickpeas, \u2013 Best falafels are made with soaked and drained dry chickpeas. Canned chickpeas are way too soft as they are cooked andl do not do well in this recipe., , The falafel mixture made with canned chickpeas tend to be very soft and the fried bals turn out soft instead of crispy., , Get the consistency of mixture right-, the consistency of the mixture should be coarse yet not very much. If you try to make a ball with the pulsed mixture you should be able to and it should hold shape., , Do not add water while processing., , If the mixture is very coarse the balls will break while frying and on the other hand if you make the mixture very pasty it will spoil the texture of falafels., , To add flour or not for binding-, As I have mentioned above I never add any flour for binding. If you have soaked the chickpeas well and drained thoroughly you don\u2019t have to add any flour., , If at all you find your mixture very loose and not holding you can add 2-3 tablespoons of rice flour or chickpea flour., , While shaping if you have difficulty or find the mixture difficult to handle, you can refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes just like we do with some cookie dough. Chilling the mixture makes it tight and eases the shaping., , Get the oil temperature-, to make perfect falafels that are crispy from outside with fluffy light interior, the oil temperature has to be right. If the oil is not hot enough, the falafels will turn dense and hard. If it is too hot, they will brown quickly from outside while the inside will remain uncooked., , What we need here is hot but not smoking oil for frying that is around 375 F or 190 C if you use a thermometer. Another age old way to check oil temperature is you drop a small bit it should rise and float immedietly. Tis is the right temperature for frying., , , this vegan and gluten free Mediterranean snack is such a treat., , , 4.20, from, 21, votes, , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , , Prep Time, 12, hours, , hrs, , 30, minutes, , mins, Cook Time, 30, minutes, , mins, Total Time, 13, hours, , hrs, , , , , , , Course, Appetizer, Side Dish, Snack, Cuisine, Middle Eastern, , , , , , Servings, 15, , falafels, Calories, 96, , kcal, , , , , 1 CUP = 250 ml, , , 1x, 2x, 3x, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , dried chickpeas, \u25a2, 1, , small onion, , quartered, \u25a2, 3, , garlic cloves, , peeled, \u25a2, 1/2, , cup, , cilantro leaves, \u25a2, 1/2, , cup, , parsley leaves, \u25a2, 2, , teaspoons, , ground cumin, \u25a2, 2, , teaspoons, , ground coriander, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , ground pepper, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , red chili powder or paprika, \u25a2, salt, , to taste, \u25a2, oil, , for fryinh,  Instructions: , Soak Chickpeas-, Pick rinse and soak 1 cup chickpeas in plenty of water for 8-12 hours.

Pick up a portion and try to make a ball to check consistency. refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes., , , Shape and fry-, Make small balls from the prepared mixture., , Heat oil for deep frying.

Flip the balls half way ad bake till crispy and golden., , Ways to serve falafel, , As snack with dip, \u2013 Most easiest way is to serve this as evening snack with any creamy dip like sour cream dip, tahini sauce or yogurt dip. Here I made a quick vegan yogurt dip with cashew curd.You can serve with tahini sauce or hummus., , , falafel salad-, My most favorite way to serve this snack. make a quick middle eastern salad of cucumber tomato salad with parsley. Just before serving toss the falafels and serve immedietly. You can also do this with kachumber, avocado salad., , Pita sandwich-, stuff these balls in warm pita pockets along with a salad and dip like hummus., , Make Ahead, Storage & Freezing\u00a0 Notes, , You can store the falafel mixture\u00a0 in refrigerator for 3 days. Store in airtight containers., , The shaped falafels can be frozen for 20 days. Shape the patties, line in a tray and freeze till they turn hard.

        "Roast Beetroot Falafels": "Ingredients: Beetroot falafels are even healthier than regular ones, Beetroot gets my top vote for its incredible nutritional profile. It is said that it can help lower blood pressure, improve stamina and support healthy liver function. So it was only a matter of time before it appeared in my falafel., Beetroot has excellent antioxidant properties. It is high in glutathione, polyphenols and betalains, which all have excellent anti-oxidant properties. Anti-oxidants play a key role in the prevention of most chronic diseases, due to their ability to counteract the effects of free radical damage on human tissue., Beetroot is also rich in essential nutrients such as\u2026 Folate (folic acid/B9) which is essential for DNA synthesis and repair. Manganese which is good for skin & bone health; blood sugar management; protection against free radicals.\u00a0 Helpful for blood pressure regulation and kidney health. Vitamin C \u2013 a \u00a0powerful anti-oxidant; helpful for wound healing; blood sugar regulator. This root vegetable also has good levels of zinc, iron and copper for maintaining general healthy body function., Read on here for more about, beetroot, \u2026, The Health Benefits of Beetroot, Coriander leaves (cilantro) are a wonderful addition to these beetroot falafels, with its hint of green to compliment the beetroot red and its plethora of antioxidants and beneficial nutrients. It doesn\u2019t dominate the flavour, but simply compliments it (and if you don\u2019t like coriander leaves you can swap for parsley or just leave it out altogether)., Continue to Content, , , , Roast Beetroot Falafels with Tahini Sauce - easy gluten-free vegan deliciousness, , Yield:, , 10, , Cook Time:, , 16 minutes, , , Total Time:, , 16 minutes, , A delicious beetroot inspired falafel recipe with the addition of optional coriander (cilantro) leaves. Baked or grilled (broiled if you are in the USA) to maintain a wonderful, healthy, gluten-free, vegan falafel., , Print, 2 beetroots (just under tennis ball size), 2 large garlic cloves, 250g (2 cups) cooked chickpeas, 1 handful fresh coriander leaves (optional), 1 tablespoon ground coriander, 1 heaped teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon sea salt, , Tahini Sauce (to serve), just broken down into tiny pieces so that when you compress, everything binds together., Please watch my video (below) for a visual guide and you can't go wrong. If it seems a little too crumbly then I recommend adding a teaspoon or two of water or olive oil. Moisture depends on how much the chickpeas have been drained or how the moisture level of the baked beetroot., Roll into balls (a little smaller than golf balls in size)., Press the balls down into mini patty shapes., Place onto a grill tray (broiler in the USA) and grill on a medium/low heat for about 8 minutes on each side., (You can also bake these in the oven as an alternative to grilling)., Serve right away., This served really well with tahini sauce - check out my, Easy Tahini Sauce Recipe here, , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, Please leave a comment on the blog or share a photo on, Instagram, \u00a9 Anastasia, , , Cuisine:, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, , /, , Category:, dinner, lunch, , Tahini Sauce Recipe\u2026, If you want to make your own chickpeas in batches from dried then check this page out here:, Pin for later\u2026, , , By, Anastasia, |, Related Posts, , , , Super EASY roast squash & lentil curry, , , Super EASY roast squash & lentil curry, , April 9th, 2025, , |, , 0 Comments, , , Wild Garlic Recipes, , , Wild Garlic Recipes, , March 26th, 2025, , |, , 0 Comments, , , Wild Garlic Olive Tapenade, , , Wild Garlic Olive Tapenade, , March 26th, 2025, , |, , 0 Comments, 51 Comments, , , Jenn, September 27, 2017 at 2:11 am, - Reply, I love that color!

What temperature are you doing it at? Are they super soft when you take them out? Or still firm, but easily cut with a knife? Also.. did you leave the skins on and just take off rought neck? Or did you eventually peel them as well?, Thanks so much!, , Sarah, August 9, 2020 at 5:25 pm, - Reply, Could we use canned beets instead?, , Anastasia, August 10, 2020 at 7:18 am, - Reply, You could adapt the recipe, although I imagine the canned beets would be a lot more moist than the baked beets, so you\u2019d need to compensate (perhaps with chickpea flour)., , Trinity @ Trinity's Conscious Kitchen, May 16, 2018 at 9:21 pm, - Reply, Hi Charlie,, Since we are just baking the beetroots, to begin with, it would be whatever high heat you consider your oven to be. Haha yes, I guess that would vary from person to person\u2026 so I would say gas mark 7 (220C or 425F). They don\u2019t need to be super soft when taken out as long as you can pierce them with a fork etc \u2013 they will break down in the food processor., Just took off the rough neck \u2013 no peeling., I hope that helps \ud83d\ude42, , Mrs Christine Williamson, August 13, 2018 at 7:17 pm, - Reply, Love the texture of these and the taste .Very easy to make also., , TrinitysKitchen, August 13, 2018 at 7:28 pm, - Reply, Happy to hear you like them \ud83d\ude42, , Mary, September 26, 2018 at 7:48 pm, - Reply, I just made these for my dinner  ~ well sort of lol ~ I used your basic recipe Trinity, then instead of the coriander & cumin, I put in some grated carrot & lemon juice and some mint from my garden, \u2019cause I love grated carrot with grated beetroot, lemon juice & mint ~ and it was delicious! \ud83d\ude42   I have saved one to have cold tomorrow with salad for lunch \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ll try your coriander & cumin one the next time ~ my beautiful body was asking for mint this evening! \ud83d\ude09 Thank you so much for your inspiration Trinity \ud83d\ude42, , Lucrezia Linardi, October 14, 2018 at 11:42 am, - Reply, , Trinity @ Trinity's Conscious Kitchen, October 18, 2018 at 10:14 pm, - Reply, Sorry about that \u2013 I was having some issues with my site a couple of days ago, you should be able to see the recipe fine now., Kindest blessings, Trinity, , Stella Millburn, October 18, 2018 at 5:08 pm, - Reply, They look beautiful, can\u2019t wait to try them!, How many people would that recipe feed?, , Trinity @ Trinity's Conscious Kitchen, October 18, 2018 at 10:13 pm, - Reply, It makes 10 falafels so I would say that was good for about three people., Just double up if you want more., , Amber, November 10, 2018 at 8:33 pm, - Reply, These were delicious!!, , Anastasia, November 10, 2018 at 8:39 pm, - Reply, Fab! \ud83d\ude42, , Mattie, December 18, 2018 at 9:51 am, - Reply, Hey, i\u2019m really looking forward to make them tonight!

Grill pan means something different in England., If that\u2019s what you mean then just do them until they are tanned then turn over and repeat. I would do on a medium to high temperature. Not sure if that helps \ud83d\ude09 Not 100% sure what you are asking though (language barrier haha \u2013 we will get there)., , Supriya, November 3, 2019 at 12:14 pm, - Reply, Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out amazing!!!

        "Vegan Spanakopita": "Ingredients: but a few brands are accidentally vegan because they use oil instead of butter. I really like the Fillo Factory frozen dough (However, always read the label first, , & Substitutions, , Yellow Onion, - Any onion or shallots can be used., Garlic, - If you don't have fresh garlic, you can sub 1 tsp garlic powder., Lemon, Nutmeg, Pepper, Frozen Chopped Spinach, - You can use fresh, but I found it easier to use frozen because it's already chopped and all you have to do is thaw it and drain it. If you use fresh, you'll need about 2 \u00bd lbs.\u00a0Thinly sliced and massaged kale can also be used., Parsley, , Vegan Ricotta, - Instead of vegan ricotta, you could use vegan feta (I love Violife feta) or make homemade vegan tofu feta. In a pinch, I've even used Kite Hill plain vegan cream cheese, which was delicious! Not as tangy as the ricotta, but it was still very creamy., Filo Dough, - If you can't find vegan filo dough, you can use vegan puff pastry instead., Olive Oil, - Any neutral oil will work. I have also made it with avocado oil and it turned out great., , , How to Make, Vegan Spanakopita, , First, saute the diced onion in a large pan until it's soft and translucent. Add the minced garlic and let it cook until fragrant, (Photo 1), . While the onions and garlic are cooking, put the thawed spinach in a piece of cheesecloth or a thin lint-free towel, twist it into a ball to seal the top, and squeeze firmly to drain any remaining water. You should end up with a softball-sized ball of dry greens, (Photo 2), ., , , Combine the cooked onions and garlic, spinach, fresh parsley, vegan ricotta, lemon zest, nutmeg, (Photos 3 & 4), .\u00a0Lay the thawed dough in between two lightly damp towels so it doesn't dry out while you're assembling the vegan spanakopita, (Photo 5), ., , , In a 9x13 casserole dish, brush the bottom with olive oil and then line it with 12 sheets of filo, brushing every other layer lightly with olive oil, (Photo 6), . The edges will hang over the dish, that's ok because you will fold them in later. Add the filling to the casserole dish and gently spread it out in one even layer, (Photo 7), ., , Top the filling with 5 sheets (brushing every other layer with oil), fold in the edges, lay the last piece on top, and tuck the edges in. Generously brush the top layer with oil, score the spanakopita into 12 pieces (only cut through the top layers), (Photo 8), , and then bake the spanakopita until the top is lightly browned and crispy., , , Serving Suggestions, , This vegan spanakopita makes a beautiful and impressive main course. Any of the following side dishes would be delicious to serve with it:, , Lemon Tahini Courgette Salad, Arugula, Avocado Tomato Salad, Pomegranate Wild Rice Salad, Salad with, Vegan Ranch Dressing, , How to Reheat It, , Store leftovers in the fridge for 1-2 days. After that, it may start to get a little soggy., , From the Fridge:, You can warm individual portions in the microwave but it won't make the topping crispy. The best way to reheat the vegan spanakopita so it gets a crispy crust is to put it in an oven-safe dish, cover it with a piece of parchment paper to protect it from burning, and bake it for 12-15 minutes at 350 degrees or until it's warmed through (depending on how big the slice is).\u00a0Take the parchment paper off for the last minute., , From the Freezer:, Bake it uncovered at 350 degrees for 60-70 minutes or until it's warmed through. If the top starts to get too dark, cover it with parchment paper to protect it., , , Recipe Variation, , you can make vegan spanakopita triangles. To do this, cut the sheets of filo into 3-inch x 10-inch strips. Work with one piece at a time and cover the remaining pieces with plastic wrap and a damp cloth so it doesn't dry out., , Brush the strip lightly with oil and then put a generous spoonful of the filling in the bottom of the strip. Fold it up into a triangle shape and keep folding until you use the whole strip. Repeat until you run out of filling. Arrange the triangles on a parchment-lined baking tray and lightly brush each triangle with oil. Bake at 375 degrees for 25-30 minutes or until they're golden and crispy., , , Frequently Asked Questions, , Can I make it the day before?, , \u25a2, 2, , lbs, , frozen chopped spinach, \u25a2, 1, , large, , yellow onion, , diced, \u25a2, 3, , medium, , garlic cloves, , minced, \u25a2, 1, , bunch, , fresh flat leaf parsley, , roughly chopped (mostly leaves, but small stems are ok if finely chopped), \u25a2, 16, , oz, , vegan ricotta, , (I used (2) 8 oz packages Kite Hill almond ricotta), \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , lemon zest, \u25a2, \u00bc, , tsp, , ground nutmeg, \u25a2, \u00bc, , tsp, , black pepper, \u25a2, \u00bc, , cup, , extra virgin olive oil, \u25a2, 1, , lb, , vegan filo dough, , thawed (I used an 18-sheet package of Fillo Factory filo dough), , Take the thawed filo dough out of the package and lay it between two slightly damp dish towels so they don't dry out. Don't open the package and expose the sheets to air until you're ready to assemble the pie., Lightly brush the bottom of a, large casserole dish with olive oil and then add 12 layers of filo dough, lightly brushing every other layer with olive oil. It's ok if the filo hangs over the edges of the casserole dish because you're going to fold them in later., Add the spinach filling and use a spatula to smooth it out evenly. Top with the remaining pieces of filo dough (brushing every other layer with oil), but reserve 1 full sheet for the top. Fold in (or trim off) all of the edges that are hanging over and then brush the corners generously with olive oil so they will get crispy. Lay the last piece of filo on top to cover the sloppy edges you just folded in and tuck the edges in., Score the pie (only cut through the top layers of filo) into 12 pieces. It's much easier to cut it now before it's crispy. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the top layer is lightly brown and crispy. Let it rest for a few minutes before removing slices from the pan., , Notes, , Store any leftover spanakopita in an airtight container in the fridge and it will stay fresh for 2-3 days.

This was the first time I worked with Phyllo dough- a little tricky Instructions: , , Is it better to freeze spanakopita cooked or uncooked?, , It's better to freeze the spanakopita uncooked. Store it in an airtight container in the freezer for 1-2 months., , , The filo is too dry and crumbly! How do I fix it?, , If the sheets have been exposed to the air for too long, they may dry out and tear when picked up. If this happens, try to patch the pieces together in the bottom of the casserole because nobody will see it. Instead of trying to piece the topping together, you can crumple each piece (like you would crumple a piece of paper) and put it on top of the pie filling. Make sure generously brush all the nooks and crannies and tips of the dough with olive oil before baking., , , Do I have to use oil?, , Oil is necessary to use to make the dough crispy. However, if you're oil-free, you can use aquafaba as a substitute, but it won't create the same dark color and crispiness as oil does., , , , Success Tips, , Take the frozen spinach and dough out of the freezer and put it in the fridge to thaw for 24 hours.\u00a0Move the dough to the counter 1-2 hours before you're making the spanakopita so the dough will be at room temperature, soft, and pliable when you're ready to use it., It's very important to drain the spinach extremely well because you don't want the pie to be soggy from excess liquid. If it still has ice crystals when you take it out of the fridge, warm it in a pan to melt the ice before you strain it., When you're assembling the vegan spanakopita, keep the layers of thawed filo in between two slightly damp dish towels so it won't dry out. Don't open the sealed bag that the dough sheets are in until right before you're ready to assemble the pie., Don't worry if the filo tears when you pick it up. Just put it in the casserole dish and match it up the best you can with the other pieces. Brush it with a little bit of olive oil and nobody will be able to tell once it has been baked., , , Want More Vegan Main Course Recipes?, , Vegan Creamy Stuffed Shells, Vegan Chickpea Curry, Vegan Mushroom Stroganoff, Vegan Beef Stew, , , , , Semi-Homemade Vegan Spanakopita, , , This vegan spanakopita is easy to make with a couple of store-bought shortcuts to save you time, but no one will ever know that it's not 100% homemade!\u00a0Filled with an extremely flavorful mixture of spinach, fresh parsley, garlic, onions, and almond ricotta sandwiched between crispy layers of filo dough, this spinach pie is simply spectacular!, , , 4.60, from, 15, votes, , , Print, , Pin, , Rate, , , Course:, Dinner, Cuisine:, American, , Prep Time:, 30, minutes, , minutes, Cook Time:, 50, minutes, , minutes, Total Time:, 1, hour, , hour, , 20, minutes, , minutes, , Servings:, 12, , servings, , Calories:, 240, kcal, , Author:, Stacey Eckert, , , Equipment, Large Pan, Cheesecloth, Large Mixing Bowl, (2) Hand Towels, 9-inch x 13-inch Casserole Dish, , Take the frozen filo and spinach out of the freezer and put it in the fridge to defrost for 24 hours. If you forget to do this the day before, you can warm the frozen spinach in a pan on the stove (right before you make the dish) until it's fully thawed., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees., In a large pan, saute the diced onion until soft and translucent. Add the minced garlic cloves and let it cook for 1 minute. It will smell very fragrant., While the onions are cooking, drain the spinach. Put the thawed spinach into a piece of cheesecloth or a thin dish towel, twist it into a ball to seal, and squeeze any remaining water out. You want the spinach to be as dry as possible., In a large mixing bowl, add the cooked onions and garlic, drained spinach, almond ricotta, lemon zest, chopped parsley, nutmeg, and we all enjoyed it on Easter, even the non-vegans. \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Nancy Andres, , , November 19, 2020 at 3:57 pm, , , , Thanks Stacey for sharing this wonderful recipe and participating in my recipe roundup, \"Guilt-free Vegan Holiday Food to Savor\" at Colors 4 Health.

It is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and MELTED in our mouths! The dairy free ricotta cheese is VERY creamy and the superb flavors of onions and garlic blend SO nicely complimenting the spinach perfectly. I loved how the philo dough got VERY  crispy fresh out of the oven too. My husband and I actually fought over who was going to get a second piece, and he even offered to do the dishes if I would give up MY piece! (I refused--so I am STILL  doing the dishes! Ha!)

The filling shouldn't taste overly tart, the lemon zest just brightens the flavor a bit. Next time you can definitely leave out the zest if you prefer or you could use half the amount and taste it before you add the rest.
