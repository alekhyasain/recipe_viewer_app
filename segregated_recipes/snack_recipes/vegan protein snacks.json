The plant milk will absorb into the starch and create a sticky surface for the breadcrumbs to adhere to., , You can use any plant milk you like, but use plain or plain and unsweetened milk for best results. I prefer to use soy milk, with oat milk as my second choice., , The breadcrumb mixture is made of panko style breadcrumbs and seasoned with paprika (I love smoked paprika here if you have it), salt, black pepper, minced parsley, and a drizzle of olive oil., , The oil adds a richness to the breading, which makes for extra tasty \u2018wings\u2019 when baked! Remember that wings are usually fried not baked so your tongue will expect some richness!, , The breaded tofu is baked on a lightly oiled pan until nice and crispy, and then tossed in a spicy buffalo sauce., , , The buffalo sauce:, , Buffalo sauce is made of hot sauce, and melted vegan butter, a bit of garlic powder, and a pinch of salt., , If you want to substitute the vegan butter for oil you can. Use refined coconut oil for a mouthfeel most similar to butter. If you use oil instead of butter you will need to add more salt to taste., , The hot sauce you choose for buffalo sauce is very important. You want a red cayenne pepper-style hot sauce, as these tend to be not too spicy (by my standards). I use, Franks RedHot, , some people prefer, Crystal Hot Sauce, and others like, Louisiana Hot Sauce, ., , If you don\u2019t have an opinion on which hot sauce to use then you better make this recipe three times with each of those hot sauce brands (and/or maybe a less mainstream one?). Then rank them and come up with a super strong opinion stat! J/k, though it would be worth eating these crispy baked buffalo tofu wings that many times in a row., , , To make buffalo sauce more or less spicy:, , The way you control the heat level when making buffalo sauce is by adding more or less [vegan] butter to the hot sauce. If you want a milder sauce, add more butter! If you want it spicier, add more hot sauce or less butter. Easy peasy., , Tips on keeping the buffalo tofu wings crispy:, , The second you add the buffalo sauce to the crisp just-baked wings they start to get soggy., , To minimize any sogginess, make sure they are very well crisped before adding the hot sauce! Also eat them immediately, don\u2019t let them sit around in sauce., , You can stick them back into the oven to re-crisp a bit after saucing. But they\u2019ll soak up the sauce and lose some of that sauciness if you do so., , On that note, enjoy the buffalo tofu wings hot out of the oven with some creamy sauce for dipping. For store bought options my favorite dressings are made by Follow Your Heart, and if you want to go the homemade route, try my, cashew ranch dressing, which I think is perfection!, , These vegan buffalo wings are a perfect for a party appetizer, and great for a munchies style dinner.

Place some weights over the wrapped tofu, like a heavy cast iron skillet or books atop a baking sheet. Let drain for about 20-30 minutes before continuing., Cut your tofu into 18 'wings' or ~1/2\" sticks. Cut the block of tofu into 6 slices width-wise if you haven't already for pressing, then slice each of those slabs into 3 slices lengthwise., Put the cornstarch (or arrowroot or tapioca starch) in one bowl, the plant milk in a second bowl, and mix together the bread crumb mixture in a third bowl. Pour some of the bread crumb mixture onto a plate., Dip each tofu 'wing' into the starch, followed by the milk, then roll in the breadcrumbs on the plate. Place the wing onto the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining 'wings.' Use one hand for the starch and bread crumbs and your other for the milk to keep breading from clumping on your fingers. Add more of the breadcrumb mixture to the plate as needed., Bake the prepared tofu at 425 \u00baF for 25 minutes, flip, then bake an additional 10-15 minutes until the tofu wings are nice and crispy., While they're baking, make the buffalo sauce.

Yes, you can do it in the air fryer (12-15 minutes on 400F). I don't press the tofu (unless it's frozen and thawed) because the brand I buy is super firm. But if your brand is less firm then you should press some of the water out first. If you're not sure, just try pressing it for 15 to 30 minutes (wrap in a clean kitchen towel and stack something heavy on top)., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Tamara, , says, , , August 23, 2020 at 10:58 pm, , , , Excellent and very easy!

If you cut it with a knife or make the edges too uniform and flat, it will have more trouble sticking. Be sure to check out the photos in the blog post to see how to best break the tofu into chunks. The paste sticks much better to the sides that are craggy and uneven. If you already did that, try using a bit of cornmeal in the batter.

This is the first tofu chicken nugget recipe that I tried, and I have no need to look further.  I had to convince myself I was actually eating tofu - THEY ARE THAT DELICIOUS!  I made the recipe exactly as written with two exceptions - I didn't have agave syrup so I substituted with maple syrup, and I let the tofu marinate in the paste overnight (for about 26 hrs).  I put my nuggets on parchment paper in my air fryer and they came out perfectly., Thank you for sharing this exceptional tofu recipe with us!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Julianne Lynch, , says, , , March 03, 2023 at 8:04 am, , , , Awesome!

I was really skeptical at first, only because some of the other \"Chickn\" recipes I've made have fell flat. But these were so great! I froze the tofu over night and let it defrost for 6 hours in the fridge, but the tofu was still rock hard! Weird. So I kept it in the fridge to thaw for the next night. I pressed the tofu before freezing AND after thawing and it was great! The batter or paste, has such a great flavor and texture. The honey mustard sauce was delicious!

Served with a creamy ranch dipping too!, , , this recipe, , How many times have been out to eat with friends, they order the buffalo wings and you drift off into a daydream where you're eating something deliciously buffalo-y yet also plant-based?, , Probably at least 100 for me!, , For me, that wing-lover in my life is Matt. He's a meat-eater, which I'm totally okay with, and definitely loves his wings. While I've never personally been a fan of chicken wings (even before I was plant-based), I do love a good buffalo sauce and the smell is so addicting!, , For all\u00a0my buffalo flavor lovers out there, I've got you. Today we're making Vegan Buffalo Quinoa Bites and serving them with a creamy ranch dressing and they are everything. Simple. Healthy. Flavorful. Protein-Packed. And freaking delicious!, , , The great thing about this recipe? It's made entirely in the food processor!, , The base is white beans, which are creamy and relatively mild in flavor, which makes them the perfect vehicle for the buffalo sauce. We're also adding in some quinoa (of course!) to help hold everything together and add in some extra protein., , Our spices are simple: just buffalo sauce, salt and pepper. Because honestly, that's all these quinoa bites need!, , , Once we blend it all up, you shape them into patties or balls!, , If you're serving these at a party, I suggest thinking about the look you're going for and the audience that you're serving them to. Got kids at the party? I like patties because they remind me of chicken nuggets. Something a little more \u201csophisticated\u201d, I'd probably go with balls because they resemble mini meatballs., , , And speaking of serving\u2026, , Let's talk about this vegan ranch dressing!, , I should preface by saying it's not a true ranch dressing, a bit more on the herbaceous side, but it's absolutely scrumptious! I actually used my, vegan caesar dressing, for inspiration, so we've got, tahini, and hemp seeds as our base, then swapped out the spices to give it a more ranch-like flavor., , Our spices? Fresh chives, onion powder, garlic powder, dried dill and lemon. The chives are what's giving it that light green color, and while not traditional, promise you'll love it!, , , These vegan buffalo bites are definitely a must-make for your next party! (whether Super Bowl or otherwise), , I also like saving some extras, or making a double batch, and keeping the leftovers for salads or bowls. They're a great source of protein and add a really nice pop of flavor. They remind me of falafels, just buffalo flavored!, , Can't wait to see your recreations, friends!
