I haven\u2019t seen a lot of pineapple stuffed sausage since then, but Hasselback potatoes sure made a comeback\u00a0and have been increasingly\u00a0popular during the last couple of years., , , The original version uses butter and breadcrumbs but we\u2019re simply using oil. I\u2019m sure some almond flour could be tossed on top towards the end of the baking, if you like it with a little crust. We also stuff herbs into the slices to\u00a0give the spuds\u00a0more flavour and that\u00a0also helps the fat to find its way inside the potato. A good trick is\u00a0to\u00a0place the potato in\u00a0a large wooden spoon when you cut it, to prevent from cutting it all the way through. Or placing it between two chopsticks or chopping boards. On the photo above, Luise uses a metal spoon which actually\u00a0makes it more difficult to slice because the potato isn\u2019t flat and it can also be bad for the knife. So not the best example. What can I tell you, she\u2019s Danish, , , As I mentioned in the intro, we\u00a0add kale, beans, tomatoes\u00a0and\u00a0onion towards the last 15 minutes of the roasting and\u00a0then serve\u00a0with pesto on the side. It\u2019s an easy one-tray dinner. It is\u00a0however\u00a0also an awesome side dish on the Christmas table. It looks really nice and Christmassy on that\u00a0bed of\u00a0kale., , While we were at it, we compiled a\u00a0list of a few other great Christmas related recipes from the archives. Last year\u2019s loaf would make an excellent companion to the potatoes., , \u2022, Christmas Spiced Parsnip Cake, \u2022, Shaved Brussels Sprouts Christmas Salad, \u2022, Mushroom, Rice & Hazelnut Loaf, \u2022, Pomegranate, Raspberry & Thyme Jam, \u2022, Saffron Falafels, , \u2022, Quinoa, Kale & Apple Salad, \u2022, Homemade Nutella, , Finally, can we just say a massive Merry Christmas / Happy Hanukkah or whatever yo are celebrating! This has been an intense year for us with\u00a0books, babies and lots more. We haven\u2019t been posting recipes as often as we intended\u00a0but we want to thank you\u00a0for\u00a0your constant support, kindness and cheering comments. We have a lot more planned in the near future so stay tuned. BIG LOVE!, , /David, Luise, Elsa, Isac and baby Gabriel, , , Hasselback Potatoes with Kale, Beans & Pesto, , The baking time can vary depending on the potato size and variety. Smaller potatoes will need a little less time., , Hasselback potatoes, , 2 kg /\u00a04 lbs (roughly 12) large\u00a0baking, potatoes, , 80 ml / 1/3 cup olive\u00a0oil, , sea salt, , black pepper, , 1 bunch fresh thyme, leaves picked, , To serve, , 3 large handfuls kale, thick stalks removed and leaves roughly chopped, , 1 small red onion, , 170 g /\u00a01 cup cooked black beans (1/2 can), rinsed, , 12 cherry tomatoes, , 100 g / 1/2 cup pesto (if you are vegan, choose a pesto without cheese), , 1. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C/400\u00b0F., 2. Wash and scrub the potatoes., 3. Slice each potato thinly. Let each slice cut about two-thirds into the potato, leaving the bottom intact. This is easiest done by placing the potatoes inside a large spoon, the edges of the spoon will then stop the knife from cutting too deep., 4. Tuck some thyme leaves sporadically between the slices of each potato and place them on a baking tray., 5. Use a brush to drizzle the potatoes with about half of the oil and then sprinkle with salt and pepper., 6. Bake for 30 minutes and then brush the potatoes with the remaining olive oil. The potatoes should have started to fan out slightly which will make it easier to get some of the oil down in-between the slices as well. If the slices are still stuck together, you can let them roast a while longer before adding the last oil., 7. Bake for 30 minutes more. Meanwhile, cut the onion in thin slices and place it in a bowl along with the kale, beans and tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper and toss to combine., 8. When the potatoes have been in the oven for about 1 hour in total, arrange the onion, kale, beans and tomatoes on the tray, around the potatoes and bake for 15 minutes more, or until the potato edges are crispy and the centre feels soft when pierced with a toothpick., 9. Drizzle pesto over the potatoes and kale and serve immediately, while still hot., , ********************, , , PS!, , We\u00a0have also updated our, Green Kitchen app, with 6\u00a0Christmas recipes.\u00a0Apart from this\u00a0Hasselback\u00a0Potato recipe and some favorites from last year,\u00a0you\u2019ll also find our\u00a0simple Sesame & Gingerbread Truffles and this delicious Saffron Overnight Oats recipe there.
