        "Garlic Vegan Almond Cheese spread": "Ingredients: (simple like my, easy kale chips, !)., , What is Nutritional Yeast?, , The one ingredient you may not have tried before is the nutritional yeast. If you haven't used it before, it can be used in many ways and is used in many vegan recipes, so buy a bag and put it in everything you want to give a little \"cheesy\" flavour to., , This recipe is also very easy and straightforward. The hardest part is being patient while the almonds soak. They need to soak for 24-hours, so be sure to plan ahead., , After the almonds have soaked, I don't peel the skin off, but you can if you'd like., , I skip that step because the skin becomes so soft after being soaked that it makes no difference to the recipe since it doesn't change the taste or the texture., , , , The only way you know the skin is still there is because you see the light brown specks in the finished spread (, look at the pictures above and below to see what I mean, )., , If you prefer to not have the almond skin as part of the spread, you can do one of two things:, , , You can either start out by using blanched raw, natural almonds, , You can peel the skin off yourself after the almonds have been soaked. The skin comes off really easily at that point, it's just a little time-consuming. It's totally up to you and whichever way you go, your result will be the same and of course, delicious!, , , Customize by Using Your Favourite Herbs, , Another good thing about this recipe is that you can alter the flavour based on your favourite herbs., , While testing, I tried making it with chives, and then with dill, and they were both so delicious, but the parsley is my favourite., , The spread is soft enough to also be used as a veggie dip., , See how versatile it is?, There are probably many other ways it can be used that I haven't tried yet!, , , , If you make my, garlic herb vegan almond cheese spread, , tell me your favourite way to use it!, , Leave a comment below, or even better, show me!

They are by a brand called \"Mary's Gone Crackers.\" They are delicious and also happen to be vegan and gluten-free.

I haven't had this happen to me before, but to fix this, think I would blend up some more almonds with a little less water and mix it into the existing mixture. You'll then have to adjust the spices to account for the extra almonds.

A regular blender will not work. (I use my, Nutri Bullet, or, Vitamix, and both work very well.), , Use only blanched or natural whole, raw, unsalted almonds for this recipe, , NOT, slivered almonds or roasted almonds., , Blanched almonds come with the skins off to make things a bit easier for you, but if you cannot find them, you can also use almonds with the skins on BUT, be sure to peel the skins after they have been soaked. This step is\u00a0 a little time consuming, so be sure to factor this into your prep time., , Use your favourite herb and be sure to chop it up really well. My favourite is parsley and I also love using dill or chives (but not at the same time!)., , After soaking your 1 cup of almonds, they will expand a little.
