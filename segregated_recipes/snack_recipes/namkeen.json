        "Chakli/Manugu Poolu": "Ingredients: , 4 cups rice flour (Store bought flour will do.), , 1 cup finely ground roasted chickpeas (Chutney dal), , Salt to taste, , Red chili powder to taste, , Few pinches of asafoetida powder, , Oil to fry (I used canola oil.), , (I added about 2 tbsp each of white sesame seeds and cumin seeds as well this time but are not generally used in this chakli.), , , Making chaklis:, , *, Heat oil in a kadai on medium flame., , *, Combine the flours, salt, chili powder, asafoetida and 1 - 2 tbsp of hot oil in a mixing bowl., Then add water slowly to the flour mixture to form\u00a0soft (not watery)\u00a0dough that can be passed through the chakli press., , *, Now to test whether the oil is hot enough\n to fry,\u00a0slowly slide a pinch of dough into the oil. If it sizzles and \ncomes to surface, then the oil is ready. If not, heat the oil a little \nlonger., , *, Take a small portion of the dough and \nfill in the chakli press.\u00a0Using your hands, press the mould over the hot\n oil making circling motion so that coils of dough from the mold \ndropping into the oil make a circle shape. (Disc with multiple stars is used to make this chakli but I used a single, star shaped\n disc here.) Or you can first press the\u00a0chakli on an\n oiled plastic sheet or a flat spoon and flip it into the oil., , Usually we make chaklis, the frying pan size instead of small ones. When they cool down, we break them into small bits and store them., , *, Flipping now and then, fry them on low flame until\u00a0they turn golden brown. Don't\u00a0let the chaklis\u00a0turn dark brown. And also don't be in a hurry and fry on high flame. They brown faster without turning crunchy., , *, Remove them with a slotted spoon\n and drain them on paper towels. Repeat the process with the remaining \ndough., , , *, Let them cool and store them in an airtight container. They will stay fresh without going stale for at least a couple of weeks and don't need refrigeration.

Please try again., , , , , , , , , Instructions: , Skip the red chilli powder/ paprika If you don\u2019t like them spicy. You can also use whatever herbs or seasonings you have. But the combination of herbs and spices I have given is a favorite at home. After trying this, you will really not like those from the fast food places any more., , Baked vs air fried vs deep fried, , Making the oven baked & the air fried potato wedges is a breeze. It only needs slicing, seasoning and then baking. I have baked potato wedges for years & that\u2019s how my kids enjoyed them always. Deep frying these is just another option if you don\u2019t have an oven., , , I have given a few helpful tips to make them extra crisp. Do read them before you try out the recipe., , , Photo Guide, , How to make Potato Wedges (Stepwise Photos), , 1. Soak and scrub 500 grams  (1.1 lb.) potatoes well with a brush and rinse them well under running water. This helps to get rid of the dirt and mud on the potatoes., , , , 2. Cut each potato lengthwise to 2 parts. I prefer to keep the skin. If you don\u2019t like you may peel it., , , , 3. Then slice each part to 3 to 4 wedges depending on the size of the potato., , , , 4. Add them to a bowl of cold water. Rest them for 30 mins. I had varying results when I skipped this step. You may experiment with and without soaking. I prefer this step. After 30 mins, drain water from the potatoes completely., , , , Seasoning, , 5. Measure all the seasonings and keep aside. Add, 1 teaspoon red chilli powder or \u00be teaspoon paprika, \u00bc to \u00bd teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, \u00be teaspoon salt, \u00bd to 1 teaspoon thyme, \u00bd to 1 teaspoon oregano, \u00be to 1 teaspoon basil, 2 tablespoons corn starch or flour. I use yellow corn flour. This is optional but I use it for crispier wedges. It also prevents the spices from getting burnt. You can use fine rice flour, wheat flour or corn starch if deep frying., , , , 6. Mix all of the spices first and taste test. Add more salt if needed., , , , , 8. Drain water from the potatoes completely and wipe them dry with a kitchen towel. I let mine air dry., , , , 9. Then pour 2\u00a0tablespoons\u00a0oil and coat them well., , , , 10. Sprinkle the seasoning prepared earlier. Coat all of the potatoes well with the seasoning. A lot of seasoning settles down at the bottom of the bowl. Mix well and coat them evenly., , , , 11. If the seasoning is too dry then sprinkle more oil if baking. If using air fryer, then you may sprinkle water., , , , Air Fryer Wedges, , 12. To air fry, , , , These potato wedges turn out absolutely delicious and crispy., , , , Oven Baked Wedges, , 13. This was another time I made for my kids without the red chilli powder. I just added the herbs, salt and oil. Arrange the potato wedges on the baking tray with the skin side down. Bake them for 30 to 35 minutes until crisp and golden., , , , 14. Adjust the baking time as needed depending on the size of the wedges and oven., , , , Deep frying potato wedges, , 15. Bring water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add salt to it., , , , 16. When the water comes to a rolling boil, increase the flame and add the potatoes., , , , 17. Boil them until the wedges are half done. Meaning they should be partially cooked and not fully or al dente cooked. This took me exactly 2 \u00bd minutes & I let the water boil consistently throughout. But the timing also depends on the size of your wedges., , 18. Once done, remove these immediately from the water and add them to a colander. I drained the whole thing to the colander. At this stage each potato wedge will have 2 colors. Transparent on top layer meaning they are cooked on the outside. They look slightly different inside meaning uncooked (not fully cooked)., , , , 19. Cool these completely and add all of the seasonings. Sprinkle some water and spread the seasoning and flour all over them., , , , 20. Ensure the masala is not dry and has coated the wedges well., , , , 21. Pour oil to a deep kadai and heat it. When the oil is hot enough drop these one by one and fry on a medium high flame until lightly golden., , , , 22. Remove them to a colander. Fry all of them in batches and remove to the colander. Refry them on a medium low heat until crisp & golden. Double frying is what makes these crispier., , , , Potato wedges are best served hot. These are good on their own but also go well with a dip like chilli sauce, garlic yogurt dip or any other of your choice., , , , More, Snacks recipes, you may like, Chilli potato, Spring rolls, Crispy corn, , Pro Tips, , Choosing potatoes:, Russet, Yukon, Maris piper are some of the best kinds to use for wedges. Avoid using waxy potatoes and new potatoes as they won\u2019t work well. If you don\u2019t know how to choose potatoes, simply use the same kind as used for making French fries., , Flour:, I prefer to use a small portion of flour for my wedges as it helps in 2 ways. Firstly it reduces the chances of the spices and herbs getting burnt. Secondly it gives an extra crisp texture to the wedges. However it is optional and you may skip it if you don\u2019t prefer., , wheat flour or corn starch work well., , Parboiling potatoes, is essential only for fried potato wedges and not for baked and air fried ones. Deep frying potato wedges without parboiling may leave them uncooked from inside., , If the potatoes are too old, have been lying for a long time in the storage, they won\u2019t fry well without parboiling.

Then cut each part to 3 to 4 wedges depending on the size of your potatoes. Each potato can give you 6 to 8 wedges., \u25a2, Add them to a bowl filled with cold water. Rest them for 30 mins. To speed up the process, you may rinse the wedges a few times in fresh cold water and soak for 15 mins., \u25a2, Meanwhile prepare the seasoning. To a small mixing bowl, add all the herbs, garlic powder, onion powder, red chilli powder and flour. Mix and taste test. Add more salt if needed.

Spread them in the air fryer basket., \u25a2, Air fry them at 200 C or 400 F for 16 to 20 mins depending on the size of the wedges. After 8 to 9 minutes, shake them gently and continue to air fry. Alternately you can also air fry them on the fries setting and towards the end air fry at 200 C or 400 F until crisp., Deep Fried Wedges, \u25a2, Bring water to a rolling boil in a large pot and add salt., \u25a2, Add the potatoes to the boiling water and cook until they are half done.

You can coagulate milk using lemon juice, vinegar or citric acid. Wash it thoroughly to get rid of the sour flavor., chhena, is more moist than paneer., When you make sweets like rasgulla, Sandesh, chum chum make sure to use and prepare fresh, chhena, , as making it in advance and storing it the refrigerator will change the texture of the sweet. It is super easy to prepare, chenna, , Also, we have used lemon juice for curdling the milk but vinegar, buttermilk, yogurt or citric acid can also be used to curdle the full-fat milk. The acidic agent has to be added to boiled milk and not after cooling down (because it won\u2019t curdle as fast) or while boiling (the, chenna, will turn hard and chewy)., Notes on, chhena recipe, . 1. To make the, chenna, , if making use of a stainless steel vessel or an old non-stick pan then add like 1-2 tbsp of water first and heat it for a few minutes. Move it in a circular motion and discard it. This water forms a protective layer and prevents the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan and scorching. 2. When the greenish water i.e. whey is separated, our milk has curdled completely. The whey has to be clear thus indicating the milk is completely curdled. 3. Tie and hang for 30 minutes for the extra water to drain out. Do not drain completely or else the, chenna, will turn into a hard block., The crumbly, soft texture makes fresh chhena an ideal choice for creating the perfect, Bengali mithai, ., Learn to make, chhena recipe, |, home made chenna, |, base ingredient for Bengali sweets, |, fresh chhena, | with detailed step by step recipe photos below., , Chhena, Chenna Recipe recipe - How to make Chhena, Chenna Recipe, , , , , , , , Tags, , , , , Indian Travel Food, , Indian Travel Food Dry Snacks, , Starters / Snacks, , Baked Indian Vegetarian Snacks, , Indian Jar Snacks, , Low Calorie Indian Snacks, , Quick Evening Snacks, , Bengali Vegetarian Recipes, , Bengali Rotis / Puri, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Preparation Time, , 10 Mins, , , , , , , Cooking Time, , None Mins, , , , , , , Total Time, , 10 Mins, , , , , , , Makes, , 44 puris, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ",

Alternatively, you can even cook the lapsi in the pressure cooker., , , , , , Cook on a medium flame till done. This will take around 6 to 8 minutes on a medium flame. Do stir the lapsi occasionally so it does not stick to the bottom of the pan., , , , , , Drain the cooked dalia using a strainer., , , , , , Refresh using cold water to stop the internal cooking of Dalia and prevent it from becoming mushy., , , , , , Transfer the cooked broken wheat in a deep bowl., , , , , , Add fenugreek leaves.

If you are facing difficulties in shaping the kobi muthia then apply little oil on your palms., , Grease a sieve with oil using a brush. This prevents the muthia from sticking to the plate.
