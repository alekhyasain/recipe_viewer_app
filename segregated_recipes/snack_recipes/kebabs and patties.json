Add about 2 Cups of water and pressure cook them for 3-4 whistles., , I shredded boiled carrots and beetroots using my food processor.

Farali Pattice is the recipe that is highly in demand while festival seasons and while fasting (Vrat), ., , [avatar user=\"soniyasaluja\" size=\"thumbnail\" align=\"right\" link=\"https://thebellyrulesthemind.net/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\" /], , Fasting is an integral part of the Indian culture. Individuals observe different kinds of fasts based on their personal beliefs and local customs.\u00a0 Fasting is usually done to either show your sincerity and resolve or to express your gratitude. This is sometimes done by giving up some type of food or all food items for a day, a few days or weeks. Here is my low-calorie version of\u00a0 Farali Pattice, made in an appe pan(Aebleskiver pan), , , We at TBRTM have cooked a lot of things in appe pan over the past few years and have learned a lot of tricks as well. Do take a look at the, 30 Appe Pan Recipes, Tips & Video, outlining how the pan should be used. We have graduated a lot in terms of taking pictures and also understanding the nuances that our readers like.\u00a0 Coming back to the recipe... Today we hit the Mumbai street food on our blog. Most of you know the famous\u00a0Batata Vadas, Sandwiches,\u00a0 Bhelpuri, Sevpuri and Dhoklas, however, not many have heard of another popular street food, the Farali Patties. I could say it is pretty much a North Indian version of Aloo Tikki, except that it's the stuffing that makes it special and different., , , The word 'Faral' means fast or fasting. The stuffing is referred to as Farali as it is specially meant for those who are fasting. These patties are very popular in most Gujarati household during fasts. Typically, they are fried, but here is my low oil / no fry version of the same, made in an appe pan(Aebleskiver pan). The recipe is pretty quick to make and the long pole may be boiling and mashing the potatoes., , , Farali pattice is a Gujarati recipe that is made during fasts. Sweet and spicy coconut, peanut and cilantro mixture stuffed in boiled potatoes, rolled in arrowroot flour. These are then fried until golden but we are cutting down the calories and making them in our\u00a0appe pan.., , , If you don't\u00a0have a appe\u00a0pan you can even shallow fry them. Enjoy with cilantro chutney,\u00a0sweetened\u00a0yogurt or tamarind chutney., , Though these patties are specially meant for vrat\u00a0(people observing\u00a0fast}, but you can enjoy them any time as I do !!, , , Use\u00a0freshly boiled and mashed potatoes., , Use freshly grated coconut in the stuffing., , You can add more dry fruits if you like. I have added only raisins but you can also add cashew or even dried cranberries., , , , , , If you liked this recipe and need some ideas and inspiration to enjoy guilt-free cooking, check out our most popular post on the blog :, , 30 Appe Pan Recipes, Tips & Video, , .

It has to be sticky and easy to shape. If it\u2019s not it means that you didn\u2019t strain the lentils very good and the composition is too wet. No problem, just add more flour until it has a dough-like consistency. Alternatively, let it rest in the fridge for 10-15 minutes., Spray a non stick pan with some oil. Not too much. Put each patty on the frying pan and let it fry about 2 minutes on each side., , , , , Notes, Now, if you don\u2019t want to make all the lentil cakes at once, you can just leave the bowl with the composition in the fridge and cover it with some plastic foil. It can sit in the fridge for 3-4 days. Anytime you want a lentil cake, just take some of it and fry the patty.

After the first few were cooked, I added some cumin and more paprika. And I chopped the (one was plenty) red pepper very fine, and it still wasn\u2019t cooked. So maybe cook them on a little lower heat for longer so they will cook through., Also, those asking if they can use green lentils, yes, but the flavor is quite different. Red lentils have a much more delicate flavor., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Stacy, , says:, , , , January 16, 2019 at 6:22 am, , , , , Hello, this recipe looks amazing!

It helps bind everything together and also gives the patties a cheesy flavor. You can skip it but you may need to add a little bit more psyllium husks. Add what the recipe asks for and if the patties don\u2019t shape easily, add a little bit more, but only after you\u2019ve let them rest a bit so they don\u2019t end up gummy., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Rina Malik, , says:, , , , October 14, 2018 at 5:02 pm, , , , , it\u2019s Definitely Delicious.

They should be crispy on the outside and a little softer in the middle. If they were too gummy, add less psyllium husks and flour the next time you make them and keep the composition in the fridge for 30 minutes before making the patties., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Lafleche, , says:, , , , July 21, 2017 at 7:52 pm, , , , , Hi can I use canned lentils?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ruxandra, , says:, , , , July 26, 2017 at 9:10 am, , , , , Sure! \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Judy, , says:, , , , July 14, 2017 at 4:46 am, , , , , Hi Ruxandra \u2013 I\u2019d like to make these patties tomorrow.

Someone asked for a vegan gravy recipe earlier here\u2019s one I use all the time and it\u2019ll blow your mind. Make a roux with any flour (2 tablespoons) and some oil (Any ok. I use avocado, olive or coconut). Slowly whisk in 1-1.5 cups boiling water mixed with some vege stock (paste, powder or cube). Add roughly Tbls miso, tsp mustard, garlic powder, couple glugs of tamari. Whisk well as it boils and achieves desired thickness.

You can also replace psyllium husks with ground flax seeds or ground chia seeds. Nutritional yeast can be skipped, as I usually add it just for the cheesy taste. Yummy sauce, too!

I didn\u2019t use flour, didn\u2019t seem to need it and they held together just fine.  I fried 1 batch in a non stick no oil pan and the other batch I cooked in the air fryer.

Soak the red lentils for a couple hours, then grind in the food processor.  I also don\u2019t use any flour.  I have not made them with potatoes due to the high glycemic load of lentils.  I like to add red onion and collard greens to mine., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Karen, , , February 19, 2022 at 10:37 pm, , , , Ty, I\u2019m definitely going to try this with your suggestions.

These are surprisingly delicious. I made them both on the stove top and in the oven and I prefer them in the oven. Bake at 400\u00b0 for 20 minutes and then finish them off under the broiler. The sauce is also delicious. I added a little bit of hot Hungarian paprika.

We used green lentils cause that\u2019s what we had, and decided to add other spices like cumin and sumac.  We used oregano to substitute the marjoram and I threw in som Lawry\u2019s because everything tastes better with that.  I didn\u2019t have vegan mayo.  I made a creamy sauce with cashews, chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, agave, a little salt and Some lemon juice.  AMAZING.
