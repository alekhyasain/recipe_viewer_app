Street food in India has become one of the most popular and sought-after meals for all age groups. Due to such high demand, it has led to so many variations to the traditional street food snacks. One such simple variation to the pav bhaji recipe is the masala pav recipe where the same pav bread and bhaji are served in a different way to make it attractive and tasty., , As I explained earlier, this recipe is no different from the, pav bhaji recipe, but served differently. It is the same bhaji and the pav but served as stuffing inside it. A sandwich or burger recipe should save a lot of time as it can be a quick bite on the move. Yet there are multiple ways it can be made. Some prefer it as stuffing and some prefer to chop it and mix it with bhaji and some only like it as a topping to the pav bread. My personal preference is to make it a sandwich which makes it a complete meal rather than as a snack with just toppings. Also, the other option of mixing it with the bhaji makes it soggy and hence I would recommend having this way of stuffing the bhaji inside the pav., , Furthermore, I would also like to add some more tips, suggestions, and variations to the, masala pav recipe, . Firstly, I would heavily recommend using small pav bread and avoiding using a burger bun. You may use the sandwich bread but I would recommend using a toaster to toast the bread and then use it for this recipe. Secondly, compared to the pav bhaji, the bhaji prepared for this recipe is spicier as it is used to stuff and as a topping. Yet it is not mandatory and you can use your leftover pav bhaji and use it to make this recipe. Lastly, the recipe has to be served immediately once it is prepared as it may turn, soggy, if rested. Hence I would recommend preparing the bhaji keeping it ready and using it whenever required., , Finally, I would request you to check my other detailed, Street Food Recipe Collection, with this post on, masala pav recipes, . It mainly includes my other related recipes, Masala Noodles, , , Roadside Kalan, , , Paneer Burger, , , Masala Mirchi Bajji, , , Cheese Dabeli, , , Aloo Masala Grilled Sandwich, , , Chai, , , Pav Bhaji Masala, , , Pav Sandwich, , , Masala Papad, . further to these i would also like to mention my other related recipe categories like,, , , Chaat Recipes, , Indo Chinese Recipes, , Sandwich Recipes, , , , , Must Read:, , , , , , , , , , , , sweets recipes, Gulab Jamun Recipe \u2013 Soft with..., , , , , , , , , , , , , paneer recipes, Matar Paneer Pulao Recipe | Kaju..., , , , , , , , , , , , , starters or entree, Cheesy Garlic Bread Recipe \u2013 Dominos..., , , , , , , , , , 00:02:12, , , , dal recipes, Dal Makhani Recipe Restaurant Style in..., , , , , , , , , , , , , curry recipes, Matar Paneer Recipe | Dhaba Style..., , , , , , , , , , , , , paneer recipes, Dahi Ke Kabab Recipe | Hung..., , , , , About Masala Pav, , It is an extension of the popular pav bhaji recipe where the pav or bread is tossed and coated with the all-vegetable bhaji masala and served. In other words, , Masala Pav, or, Bhaji Pav, is an easier or spice-tossed pav without the bhaji served separately. It is particularly, a popular choice with workers who can consume it on the go and do not bother about the side dish with it. It is also now served as a party starter or appetizer and served as a finger food with the guests., , The recipe for, Masala Pav, is very simple, yet it has many different types of variations to prepare this simple street food snack. The most common way is to apply the bhaji across the pav. The pav is toasted or pressed against the tawa with bhaji in between. The other common way is to stuff the bhaji in between and serve it like a sandwich or pav sandwich. The sandwich can also be added with fine vegetable slices to make it a complete meal., , Chef Tips for Masala Pav, , The recipe for Masala Pav is very simple and economical to prepare in a jiffy. Yet some easy and critical tips are \u2013, , , Pav Selection \u2013, The bread used has to be fresh and spongy in texture. The toasting process includes applying the bhaji generously with some pressure. Otherwise, it may crumble into fine pieces., , Bhaji Choice \u2013, Typically, bhaji is just prepared before it is used for toasting. However, the bhaji can be premade and used to toss the pav. This would certainly save time and also the same bhaji can be served with pav as pav bhaji., , Serving \u2013, Once the pav is toasted, it has to be served immediately. Otherwise, the pav may turn soggy and not pleasant to serve and consume. Also, serve it hot so that you can enjoy the melting butter experience., , Accompaniment \u2013, It tastes great when served with a dollop of butter on top of pav. Also, serve with finely chopped onions, coriander leaves, and lemon wedges., , Variation \u2013, The pav can be stuffed with the bhaji as opposed to just stuffing. Also, the bhaji can be made with cheese, and paneer to make it a more complete meal., , , Video Recipe, , , Recipe Card for Masala Pav, , , , , Masala Pav Recipe | Bhaji Masala Pav | Mumbai Street-Style Pav Masala, , , HEBBARS KITCHEN, , , Easy Masala Pav Recipe | Bhaji Masala Pav | Mumbai Street-Style Pav Masala, , , 4.84, from, 25, votes, , , , , , , Email, , Tweet, , Share, , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , , Save Recipe, Saved!, , , , , , Prep Time, 10, minutes, , mins, Cook Time, 25, minutes, , mins, Total Time, 35, minutes, , mins, , , , , , , Course, indian street food, Cuisine, street food, , , , , , Servings, 6, , Servings, Calories, 46, , kcal, , , , , , , 1x, 2x, 3x, for masala bhaji:, \u25a2, 1, , tbsp, , butter, \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , kasuri methi, \u25a2, 3, , clove, , garlic, , , finely chopped, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , ginger paste, \u25a2, 1, , onion, , , finely chopped, \u25a2, \u00bd, , capsicum, , , finely chopped, \u25a2, \u00bc, , tsp, , turmeric, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , chilli powder, \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , pav bhaji masala, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , salt, \u25a2, 2, , tomato, , , finely chopped, \u25a2, 2, , tsp, , lemon juice, \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , coriander, , , finely chopped, for toasting:, \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , butter, \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , coriander, , , finely chopped, \u25a2, \u00bc, , tsp, , pav bhaji masala, \u25a2, 6, , slice, , pav, \u25a2, onion, , , finely chopped,  Instructions: , Firstly, in a large kadai heat 1 tbsp butter, 1 tsp kasuri methi, 3 clove garlic and\u00a0\u00bd tsp ginger paste., Saute slightly until it turns aromatic., Now add\u00a01 onion and saute slightly. do not brown the onions, just saute until it turns translucent., Also, add \u00bd capsicum and saute slightly., Further, add\u00a0\u00bc tsp turmeric, \u00bd tsp chilli powder, 2 tbsp pav bhaji masala and \u00bd tsp salt., Saute for a minute making sure the spices turn aromatic., Now add\u00a02 tomato and saute until tomatoes turn mushy., Further, mash the tomatoes until it turns silky smooth., Add\u00a02 tsp lemon juice and 2 tbsp coriander.

Then you just spread the whole cooked batter on it and can spread it in your own pace. A large wooden or metal tray would also be good., , , , 8. Also mix 2 tablespoons\u00a0of chopped coriander leaves and 2 tablespoons fresh grated coconut. Keep aside., , , , 9. Keep on stirring when the khandvi batter is getting heated up. Lumps begin to form and you have to continuously stir so that the lumps don\u2019t form., , , , 10. The batter would thicken and keep on thickening. Keep on stirring. Best to use a wooden spatula or a heat proof silicon spatula., , , , 11. You will see the khandvi batter has thickened more than the previous pic., , , , 12. Stir and stir and exercise your hands.\u00a0The batter also should not be allowed to stick at the bottom. So you have to stir continuously., , , , 13. A well thickened batter and looks like we are ready., , , , 14. So I just spread a few teaspoons of the batter on a greased lid. As you see the texture is still wet., , , , 15. Once the spread batter cooled a bit, I tried rolling. As you see the rolls could not be formed. The batter was still pasty, sticky and not properly set., , , , 16. So the batter needs to be cooked more., , , , 17. Continue to stir., , , , 18. This is the, Final consistency of the khandvi batter, . It took me 17 minutes to get the correct consistency on a low flame. The timing will vary depending on the intensity of the heat, the thickness/thinness of the pan and the size of the pan., , Just do the plate test and when you can form the rolls, then the khandvi batter is ready. If the batter becomes too thick, then it becomes difficult to spread and you don\u2019t get thin layers in the rolls. In this case, still spread the batter. You will get thick slices, but still they taste good., , , , 19. Tested again and this time the rolls were happening. This time the batter had spread evenly and there is a smoothness in the layers as well as in the spread batter., , , , Making Khandvi Rolls, , 20. Quickly pour about \u00bd to \u2154 cup of batter on a large plate and spread thinly and evenly with a spatula., , You have to be quick with the remaining batter too. Since even a bit of cooling and the batter becomes likes blob, difficult to spread. If you use a large tray or a parat, then its much easier as you don\u2019t hurry like a harried woman here and there., , , , 21. Allow to cool and then sprinkle the coconut + coriander leaves mixture sparingly. You can also skip this stuffing part and directly garnish with the coconut and coriander once you temper the khandvi rolls., , , , 22. Cut into equal sized strips., , , , 23. Gently roll each strip tightly. Then place them in a serving tray or plate next to each other or stack them neatly. If the tray or plate is large, then you will get large khandvi rolls. In this case after you finish rolling half, just cut horizontally\u00a0and make\u00a0a second roll., , , , Tempering for khandvi, , 24. For the tempering, heat 1 tablespoon oil and crackle 1 teaspoon mustard seeds., , You can use any neutral flavored oil., , , , 25. Then add 8 to 10 curry leaves and 1 teaspoon green chilies. Fry for a few seconds., , , , 26. Add 2 teaspoons white sesame seeds and when they change color, splutter and crackle., , , , 27. Pour this hot tempering mixture along with the oil on the khandvi rolls., , , , 28. You can garnish it with some more coconut and coriander leaves, if you prefer. Serve khandvi with coriander chutney or coriander mint chutney., , , , If you are looking for more, Gujarati recipes, then do check:, , Alu vadi, Rava dhokla, Dhokla recipe, Handvo recipe, Khaman dhokla, , , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

But I also have my share of disasters once in a while. Only, if I have to blog a recipe, then I use measuring cups and spoons., , , , I have given details and tips wherever possible so that you can also make this snack at home without any failure. The proportions of this recipe is enough for a family of four to five. The recipe yields 25 to 30 khandvi rolls. Also it depends on how thinly or thickly you spread the batter., , To make khandvi, the proportion of gram flour/besan to buttermilk is 1 : 3. The buttermilk should be neither thin nor thick, but of medium consistency. I have mixed sour yogurt with water for the buttermilk. I always spice up the khandvi batter with ginger and green chili paste. But skip if you don\u2019t prefer the taste or aroma of ginger., , There is a slight variation in this khandvi recipe. Usually in khandvi, coconut and coriander are added as a garnish. Here I have lightly stuffed the khandvi with these. More like the way suralachi vadi (the Maharashtrian version of khandvi) is made. If you don\u2019t prefer the stuffing, then just garnish it with coconut and coriander leaves., , Khandvi is a gluten-free healthy snack if you don\u2019t add asafoetida powder or use wheat free asafoetida. The recipe can also be veganized using vegan yogurt. To get the sourness, just add a bit of lemon juice in the batter., , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to make Khandvi Recipe, , , making khandvi batter, Take the yogurt in a bowl. Add water and stir well till smooth., Add ginger-green chili paste, turmeric powder, asafoetida and salt., If using fresh yogurt, then to add the sourness, add about \u00bd tsp of lemon juice., Add the gram flour/besan. With a wired whisk, keep on stirring and mixing till all the lumps are dissolved and you get a smooth batter. There should be no lumps in the batter. You can also use a hand held beater to mix the batter., Spread oil on plates or boards or tray. Large steel lids or thalis work very well.
