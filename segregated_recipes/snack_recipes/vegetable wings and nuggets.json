This recipe is a lot more flavorful than store-bought, especially with the addition of smoked paprika; you can also control the oil and salt content when you\u2019re DIYing it., , , I love serving these tots as a side for a, veggie burger, , or you can place them on a sheet pan and top them with, vegan queso, , , bacon, , and other toppings to make the most epic totchos you\u2019ve ever tasted., , WATCH THE VIDEO TO SEE HOW IT\u2019S MADE:, , , , , , , , , Sweet potatoes, \u2013 Any variety will work in this recipe., , Smoked paprika, \u2013 Smoked paprika isn\u2019t the same as standard paprika; if you don\u2019t have smoked paprika on hand, I definitely recommend picking it up!, , Garlic powder, , Onion powder, , Sea salt, , Coconut oil, \u2013 I love the way coconut oil compliments the flavor of sweet potatoes, but you can use another cooking oil if you prefer., , Cornstarch, \u2013 The secret to a crispy, crunchy exterior!, , , How to Make Sweet Potato Tater Tots, , While these require more work than frozen tater tots, they\u2019re still quite easy to make! Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to do., , Prepare., Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C and line two baking sheets with either silicone baking mats or well-greased parchment paper., , , , Parboil the sweet potatoes., Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then carefully place the sweet potatoes into the water and parboil them for 18 to 20 minutes, or until they\u2019re still firm, but they can be easily pierced with a fork. Drain and rinse with cold water., , , , , , Prep the sweet potatoes., Once the sweet potatoes have cooled, peel off the skins using your fingers or a spoon. Grate the sweet potatoes into a large bowl., , , , , , Add the paprika, garlic and onion powders, cornstarch, salt, and a tablespoon of coconut oil to the bowl with the shredded sweet potatoes. Stir to combine., , , , , , Form your tots., Use a tablespoon to scoop out the tater tot mixture, then form it into a tot shape with your hands.

Brush the finished tots with oil., , Bake., Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the tater tots for 20 minutes; flip them over, then bake for another 20 minutes, or until they\u2019re crispy and golden brown. Cool slightly, then serve., , , , Tips for Success, , Here are some tips to make sure your sweet potato tots turn out perfect every time!, , , Keep an eye on the potatoes., Sweet potatoes come in so many shapes and sizes, which means cooking times can vary! I recommend buying two potatoes that are similar in size and shape; if you use smaller potatoes, check for doneness after about 15 minutes., , Cornstarch substitutes., If you can\u2019t use cornstarch, don\u2019t just omit it\u2014it helps hold the tots together and gives them that signature crunchy exterior. You can substitute all-purpose flour, tapioca starch, or arrowroot powder., , Adding salt., If you want to season these with additional salt, I recommend doing so right when you take them out of the oven. The salt will stick better when the tots are piping hot!, , , , , How to Store and Reheat Homemade Tater Tots, , If you have leftover sweet potato tots, they can go in an airtight storage container and be refrigerated for up to 3 days. To keep that exterior nice and crispy, reheat them in an oven set to 350\u00baF for about 15 minutes, or until warmed through., , Can I Freeze This Recipe?, , Yes, you can freeze these!\u00a0To keep them from sticking together, freeze them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then when they\u2019re frozen through, you can transfer them to a freezer bag. Bake them in the oven at 350\u00baF until they\u2019re warmed through or thaw them in the fridge overnight, then reheat in your oven or toaster oven., , , , , , , , Enjoy friends!

Please try again., , , , , , , , , Instructions: Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F/220\u00b0C. Line two baking sheets with silicone mats or well greased parchment paper., Set a pot of water to boil. Add in the sweet potatoes and parboil for 18-20 minutes. This works best for larger sweet potatoes (like two large), so if using smaller sweet potatoes start to check around 15 minutes that a fork can stick into the middle of it, but is still firm., Remove from boiling water and run cold water over the potatoes to stop them from cooking. Allow to cool completely. Once potatoes are cooled, use your fingers or a spoon and peel the skins off. They should slip off very easily., Using a large side of a grater, grate all of the sweet potatoes, then add shreds into a large bowl., Add in the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cornstarch, sea salt and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. Using a spatula, stir everything together to combine throughly. The mixture should be cooked through, and soft enough to squeeze together., Now, it\u2019s time to form the tater tots. Using a tablespoon measurer, press the sweet potato mixture into the measurer. Then scoops out with your hands and form like a tater tot above in the photos \u2013 hold both ends with index finger and thumb, then rub/roll the centre into little tot. Line the baking sheets with the tater tots \u2013 leaving enough space so that they do not touch. You should get at least 30 tots., Using a regular or silicone pastry brush, brush the tater tots with the rest of the coconut oil on the outsides. This will really help it to crisp up. I like to brush both sides., Bake the tater tots in the middle rack of your oven for 40 minutes, flipping once at 20 minutes to get both sides well golden brown., Remove from oven and allow to cool slightly. Serve with your favourite dip, top with more salt if desired and enjoy!, , , Notes, Notes, , , , * if you can\u2019t use cornstarch you can sub tapioca starch or arrowroot powder, or even flour., , , , , Storing in Fridge:, If you have leftover sweet potato tots, they can go in an airtight storage container and be refrigerated for up to 3 days., , , , Reheating:, To keep that exterior nice and crispy, reheat them in an oven set to 350\u00baF for about 15 minutes, or until warmed through., , , , Freezing:, You can freeze these in a flat layer like on a baking sheet (not touching), then when they are all frozen you can put them in a bag together.
