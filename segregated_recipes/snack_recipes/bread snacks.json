A Non-Fried Snack, , , , , , , , , Nutrient values, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , chhena recipe, |, home made chenna, |, base ingredient for Bengali sweets, |, fresh chhena, | with 13 amazing images., chhena, is coagulated milk which acts a base for various, Bengali delicacies, like, Rasgulla, , , Sandesh, and, Chum Chum, ., chhena, is used as the base ingredient for Bengali sweets., Paneer and, chhena, , chhena, has its moisture retained whereas paneer is set to get a firm block. You can coagulate milk using lemon juice, vinegar or citric acid. Wash it thoroughly to get rid of the sour flavor., chhena, is more moist than paneer., When you make sweets like rasgulla, Sandesh, chum chum make sure to use and prepare fresh, chhena, , as making it in advance and storing it the refrigerator will change the texture of the sweet. It is super easy to prepare, chenna, , Also, we have used lemon juice for curdling the milk but vinegar, buttermilk, yogurt or citric acid can also be used to curdle the full-fat milk. The acidic agent has to be added to boiled milk and not after cooling down (because it won\u2019t curdle as fast) or while boiling (the, chenna, will turn hard and chewy)., Notes on, chhena recipe, . 1. To make the, chenna, , if making use of a stainless steel vessel or an old non-stick pan then add like 1-2 tbsp of water first and heat it for a few minutes. Move it in a circular motion and discard it. This water forms a protective layer and prevents the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan and scorching. 2. When the greenish water i.e. whey is separated, our milk has curdled completely. The whey has to be clear thus indicating the milk is completely curdled. 3. Tie and hang for 30 minutes for the extra water to drain out. Do not drain completely or else the, chenna, will turn into a hard block., The crumbly, soft texture makes fresh chhena an ideal choice for creating the perfect, Bengali mithai, ., Learn to make, chhena recipe, |, home made chenna, |, base ingredient for Bengali sweets, |, fresh chhena, | with detailed step by step recipe photos below., , Chhena, Chenna Recipe recipe - How to make Chhena, Chenna Recipe, , , , , , , , Tags, , , , , Indian Travel Food, , Indian Travel Food Dry Snacks, , Starters / Snacks, , Baked Indian Vegetarian Snacks, , Indian Jar Snacks, , Low Calorie Indian Snacks, , Quick Evening Snacks, , Bengali Vegetarian Recipes, , Bengali Rotis / Puri, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Preparation Time, , 10 Mins, , , , , , , Cooking Time, , None Mins, , , , , , , Total Time, , 10 Mins, , , , , , , Makes, , 44 puris, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ",
        "Air Fried Egg Puffs:": "Ingredients:  Instructions: ",
        "Air Fryer Bread Rolls": "Ingredients: , , , Slices of Bread, . Thick slices are preferred by me as they seal better and hold the stuffing also better., , Stuffing of the Rolls, . Traditionally, Potato stuffing is used to fill inside the Bread Roll., , , How to make a Bread Roll?, , Making a Bread Roll is a simple recipe. It is a few Steps Recipe., , , Preparing the Stuffing for the Bread Roll., , Getting the Slice of Bread Ready to make a Roll., , Making a Roll by placing the stuffing inside the bread and rolling + sealing it tight., , Deep Frying the Bread Roll. And now we can Air Fry these Bread Rolls with much less guilt., , , , , Air Fryer Bread Rolls -Delicious Vegetarian Appetizer, , What other kinds of fillings or Stuffings can be used inside a Bread Roll?, , As I have mentioned above, Potatoes are used to make the stuffing. But recipes are meant to be adapted. You can make any stuffing to fill up these rolls. Here are a few suggestions., , , Potato Stuffing, \u2013 Use boiled potatoes. Add seasonings and flavorings of your choice. I always use CURRY SEASONING. You may use Italian herbs, or just black pepper + salt, or any seasoning of your choice., , Add Peas to the Potatoes, . Just thaw and microwave the peas, add these to the potatoes with the seasoning of your choice., , You may, add Paneer, (Indian Cottage Cheese) to the potatoes also., , Cheese is a great addition, to this filling. I normally add a cube of cheese or shredded cheese in the middle of the stuffing and then work around., , You may, add other minced vegetables, to this stuffing like broccoli, cabbage, carrots, beans etc., , Onions and Garlic can be easily added, to the stuffing., , You may either, pre-cook the stuffing, on gas top. Or use just the boiled vegetables. I do not cook my stuffing., , , Save 30.0% on select products from Folinstall with promo code 301KJHD9, through 11/30 while supplies last., , Air Fryer Bread Rolls -Delicious Vegetarian Appetizer, , Benefits of Using an Air Fryer, , Investing in an Air-Fryer is the best thing I have done so far., , , The most important benefit of using an AIR FRYER is, , \u2013 GUILT-FREE COOKING & EATING., , Most of my, Deep Fried Favorites can now be done in minimal oil, and still crisp and delicious., , It gives me the option of eating my favorite still, maintaining a healthier lifestyle, ., , Air-Frying food does not leave that stale oily smell in the house either which otherwise is prominent when deep frying., , Many of the air-fryer recipes can be oven baked too.
