It adds moisture and makes a golden crust with a pronounced yet delicate olive oil flavor., , Essentially, it\u2019s an, emulsion of olive oil, water, and salt, that you spread on the surface of the focaccia.

Believe me, its golden, crisp oil-scented crust and chewy texture, are absolutely delicious., , , Prep Time, 10, minutes, , mins, Cook Time, 20, minutes, , mins, Proofing time, 1, hour, , hr, , 10, minutes, , mins, Total Time, 1, hour, , hr, , 40, minutes, , mins, , , Course:, Appetizer, Bread, Cuisine:, Italian, Keyword:, Quick Italian focaccia, , Servings:, 6, , Calories:, 307, kcal, , Author:, Katia, , Preheat the oven to, 200F\u00b0/90C\u00b0, and turn it off. This helps to create a warm oven to speed up the proofing time. Feel free to skip this step, but allow an extra 20 minutes until the dough doubles in size., Combine flour, salt, yeast in a large bowl., Add water, olive oil, and mix with a spoon or a spatula to incorporate the flour (see notes). Mix until no dry flour remains, but lumps are totally fine., Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel, then let it rest in the warm oven for 40 minutes (or until the dough doubles in size), Grease a baking tray or line with parchment paper, (mine is 9 x 13 inches)., Scrape the edges of the bowl with a spatula and pour the dough onto the baking tray., Dust with some flour (the dough is sticky and you need to dust it with flour a little bit) and press the dough out with your fingers to fit the baking tray., Place the baking tray in the warm oven again for 20 minutes. No worries if the oven is less warm now, there's no need to preheat it again., Meanwhile make the brine by placing the olive oil, the water and the fine salt in a jam jar and shake vigorously until emulsified., Remove the baking tray from the oven, pour the brine all over the focaccia and poke dimples into the surface with your fingertips, you want to fill the holes with the brine. Let it rest for 10 minutes., Preheat the oven to, 400\u00b0F/200\u00b0C., Scatter the focaccia with fresh rosemary and the sea salt flakes (optional, but I love them) and bake in the preheated oven until golden and crusty, it will take about 20-25 minutes., Let it cool for 10 before slicing and serving. Enjoy!, , , Notes, Quantities:, the recipe yields, 6 square slices, like the ones shown in the picture. But if you serve focaccia as an appetizer, you can turn those 6 servings at least into 24 bite-sized smaller nibbles., , Brine:, if you use a smaller round pan (for example a 9 inches/25 cm, \u00d8), you need to reduce the brine by half., , Storage:, focaccia\u00a0is best the day it is made but can be stored in an\u00a0airtight container, at room temperature, for up to 1 day. Plus, it freezes very well., , Measurements:, , I use both, US cups, and, grams., The cups of flour are, leveled, :\u00a0fill the measuring cup all the way to the top letting the flour flow over a little. \u00a0Then, use the back of a knife to level\u00a0the top\u00a0off., , Flour:, , all-purpose flour is perfect for focaccia bread, but you can use also bread flour., , Yeast:, you might need to extend the proofing time if needed., , Water absorption:, water absorption is the amount of water taken up by flour and may vary significantly depending on the type of flour, brand, and weather conditions. When you add water to the flour, start with the amount stated in the recipe., If the liquid is not enough to achieve that dough consistency as shown in the pictures above, just add gradually a little extra water until the flour\u00a0has been incorporated., , , preheating the oven at low temperatures creates a warm environment\u00a0for the dough to rise in faster. This shortcut works great when you\u2019re in a hurry and want freshly baked focaccia ready in record time., , Focaccia ready in 1 hour:, except for the proofing time. \u00a0For the first proofing, cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel, then let rest in the warm oven for 20 minutes only. The second time, when the dough is in the baking tray, place it in the warm oven for 20 minutes. After this time, add the brine and bake as per the recipe., , Nutritional values:, the nutritional facts are estimates only., , , , , , Nutrition, Calories:, 307, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 32, g, |, Protein:, 4, g, |, Fat:, 18, g, |, Saturated Fat:, 2, g, |, Sodium:, 292, mg, |, Potassium:, 45, mg, |, Fiber:, 1, g, |, Sugar:, 1, g, |, Vitamin C:, 1, mg, |, Calcium:, 6, mg, |, Iron:, 2, mg, , , , Join my newsletter for free weekly recipes!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Post navigation, , Previous, , Previous, Roasted Onions, Next, Continue, , Artichoke Soup, , , 48 Comments, , , Comments navigation, , Older comments, , , , , , , , Jo Ann, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I was looking for a good but easy way to make Focaccia this recipe is great.

Drain potatoes and mash with \u00bc cup unsweetened plant milk, 2 teaspoon vegan butter, and \u00be teaspoon salt. Set aside., , , Vegetables, , , Heat 2-3 teaspoon vegan butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add garlic, onion, carrots, broccoli, bell pepper, and mushrooms. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Add spinach and green onion. Saut\u00e9 until tender. Season with a pinch of salt (about \u215b-1/4 tsp)., , Mash vegetables into potato mixture. Refrigerate mixture until cool enough to handle., , , Forming and Breading Patties, , , Measure out approx. 2 tablespoon of potato mixture, roll it into a ball and flatten into a \u00be\" patty. Arrange patties on parchment paper. Makes 14-18 patties. Chill or freeze so that patties are firm before breading., , Gather 3 bowls or shallow dishes. Fill the first with \u00bd cup flour, the second with a well-blended mixture of unsweetened plant milk, cornstarch and salt, and the third with panko bread crumbs., , Dip each patty briefly into flour, followed by the cornstarch thickened milk, and then the bread crumbs. Firmly press the bread crumbs into the patties., , , Frying or Baking the Croquettes, , , Frying: Heat \u00bd\" of oil over medium heat. Once oil is evenly hot, fry patties in batches of 1-5 (depending on size of oil vat), flipping after about 1-1 \u00bd minutes. Each patty should be golden-brown and fully heated within 2 \u00bd-3 minutes., , Notes: Overheating will cause the potato filling to spill out. Make sure oil is hot enough to sufficiently brown the patties in 3 minutes or less or the filling may spill out., , Baking: Preheat oven to 450F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Baked breaded croquettes for 10 minutes. Flip and bake for another 5-10 minutes., , , , , , , Notes, , , Customization:, Feel free to play around with the types and amounts of vegetables used. You'll want a total volume of 1 \u00be - 2 cups of finely chopped veggies., Notes on Baking, :, The white panko breaded croquettes don't brown very well in the oven and end up looking a little pale and unattractive.

Put your panko in a frying pan with a small amount of oil (I use olive oil) and brown that panko up. That small bit of oil will help it taste more like its fried cousins (or... it *should*. I haven't tried it with this recipe, which helps those of us trying to shed a few pounds to feel less like we're missing out on fried foods., , Just remember to let the panko cool down before you start breading with it., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Brittany, , , October 20, 2019 at 2:05 pm, , , , That's an awesome tip!

You won't need to defrost before reheating - you can cook them from frozen. For crispy croquettes, I recommend baking them in 350F oven for 15-20 minutes or so (flipping halfway through). They could be eaten cold but I think they're best warm. You could also pop them in the microwave for a minute or so but they won't be crispy. I hope that helps!
