        "Aloo Tuk": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make aloo tuk with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , sindhi style aloo tuk preparation:, , , , , 6, , how to make chaat using aloo tuk:, , , , , 7, , notes:, , , , , , aloo tuk recipe | sindhi tuk recipe | alu tuk ka chat | sindhi aloo tuk, with step by step photo and video recipe. potatoes are an ideal source of snacks recipe across the globe. it is made as chips, wedges, fries, pakora\u2019s, and even served as salads with mashed potatoes or boiled potatoes. one such easy and simple snack recipe from the sindhi cuisine is the aloo tuk or potato tuk chaat recipe known for its spice and flavour offering., , well, many would easily embrace and cherish this recipe, but back in your mind, you would get this question? like how is this different from the normal aloo chaat or any other deep-fried potato snack. well, it mainly differs from the potatoes used and also the way it is deep-fried and tossed with the spices. firstly the baby potatoes are deep-fried as a whole without any chopping or slicing. later it is smashed and deep-fried again to make it crisp like chips. once it is crisp, it is tossed with a blend of spices which gives it a unique taste, colour and flavour to it. at this stage, it can be served as it is or it can be extended as a chaat recipe with toppings like finely chopped onions, tomatoes and mixture sev. you can serve these as a snack or as an appetizer or even as a side to your lunch or dinner meal., , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the sindhi, aloo tuk recipe, . firstly, i haven\u2019t used baby potatoes for this recipe as i was not able to get it for this recipe. having said that i would heavily recommend using the baby potatoes if you get access to it. small potatoes would do the trick, but baby potatoes are just perfect. secondly, the chaat recipe is just an extension to the traditional alu tuk. it is not mandatory to prepare it as the plain spiced aloo\u2019s should do the trick. moreover, you can also add, ragda, , channa or any chaat gravies to make it more interesting. lastly, if you prefer to have mild or less spicy aloo, you can reduce or even skip the spice tossing step. you can just toss it with butter and, pepper, for some heat., , finally, i request you to check my other, snacks recipes collection, with this post of, aloo tuk recipe, . it mainly includes my other related recipe collection like, spring rolls, , , maggi pizza, , , bread paneer pakora, , , rasam vada, , , pizza cutlet, , , methi ka nashta, , , tomato

        "Onion Bonda with spicy chutney": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make onion bonda with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , how to make crispy onion boda:, , , , , 6, , how to make red chutney:, , , , , 7, , notes:, , , , , , , onion bonda recipe | vengaya bonda | eerulli bonda & red chutney recipe, with step by step photo and video recipe. bonda recipes are generally made with a choice of flour like maida or urad dal with a crisp texture. but it is not limited to these flours and can be made with other flours with a combination of vegetables. one such recipe is the onion bonda recipe made with the combination of sliced onions with gram flour coating for a crisp and tasty snack., , street food and deep-fried snacks are very much synonymous with indian cuisine. especially with the south indian cuisine, it is mostly bonda, bajji\u2019s and pakora\u2019s. but the, onion bonda, is the new entry which is very much influenced by the crispy, onion pakora, or pakoda from the, kadhi pakoda recipe, . the uniqueness of this recipe is the crispiness it has to offer from the outer surface and the softness on the inside. hence this bonda can also be served between a pav bread-like vada pav. moreover, with this recipe, i have specifically chosen a spicy red chatni recipe which is very much inspired by, schezwan chutney, . it makes an ideal dip to this crispy bonda snack, but can also be served with many other deep-fried snacks., , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variations to the, onion bonda recipe, . firstly, the most critical part of this recipe is the chopping of onions. it shouldn\u2019t be finely chopped, at the same time it shouldn\u2019t be diced. i have sliced these onions thinly, and cut it into 3 equal parts. in this way, it would easily hold the besan batter to form a round ball. secondly, if you wish to have crisper, you can either add more rice flour or cornflour with gram flour. in addition, you can also add other vegetables like capsicum, or any leafy vegetables. lastly, make sure the dough is tight with less water content so that it does not absorb more oil. also deep fry these in small batches and do not overcrowd them in your deep frying, pan, ., , finally, i would like to mention my other related, street food recipes collection, with this post of, onion bonda recipe, . it includes my other similar recipes like, masala mirchi bajji, , , kanda bhaji pav, , , onion samosa, , , stuffed onion rings, , , pyaz ki kachori, , , onion rings, , , mysore bonda, , , tomato bajji, , , veg

Like you I am always trying to reinvent soggy oily goodies.  Just a thought.  If the batter were slightly thick, the bondas could be dipped in the batter and then placed in a well greased/brushed aebelskiver pan.  Basically, the coating should serve as a casing to hold the potato mixture.  Pouring batter over seems a bit of a messy process, though your bondas look gorgeous.  I've ordered a pan and will experiment and post my comments.  Another way.  Put the batter in a squirt bottle (ketchup bottle found at fast foods) and drizzle batter on top like pouring fondant on petit fours.  That should work.  Perhaps one would have more control with that., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Soniya Saluja, , says, , , March 11, 2016 at 3:07 pm, , , , Hello Lydia, Thanks you for your suggestions :) I had made these 1st time in 2014, made them countless times after that with different techniques.. Like you have mentioned above . What worked for me was putting the batter in a Ziplock bag ,snip the end and pour it in the cavities . Do share in your feedback with us when you try it ., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Lydia, , says, , , March 31, 2016 at 2:12 pm, , , , Hello Sonija,, , I tried the Vadas but did the batter slightly different -- 1 cup chickpea flour, 1/2 cup rice flour, 1 tbs. oil, 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. baking powder (to lighten batter since they were not being deep fried).  I brushed the cavaties with oil and pore the batter to fill 1/3rd.  Then, I quickly insert the balls of potato mixture and pored batter sparingly over ONLY to cover.  A technique that needs practise.  I pushed the excess batter around the sides with a small wooden knife then twirled the vadas using 2 wooden skewers.   Here's what I will do next time.  After I have formed the golf sized balls of the potato mixture, I will chill them awhile.  I think that will help.  They came very nice, got easier as I did them.
