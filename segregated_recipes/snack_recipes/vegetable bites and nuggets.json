You can let them cool a bit before assembling, but there's no need to as the avocado doesn't really melt. However, if you're preparing them well in advance of the party (more than an hour or so), I would dollop the avocado on when you arrive simply so that it doesn't brown.

My boyfriend has been Vegan for a decade and Since I met him I have been eating Vegan 90% of the time so I began to research and educate myself on the unfortunate facts of dairy farms and slaughter houses on the U.S. After my 30 days I decided, in part of my love for animals to go full-on Vegan. Your story inspired me and supported me in my endeavor these last few months. I love your recipes and they get me excited about making vegan cuisine.

I have recently decided to make the switch from vegetarian to vegan mainly because of sustainability issues. It is a decision that feels exciting and a huge step forward into a more authentic life. However, like you, I am extremely worried about the judgement I will receive from people. Feeling divided from people is the last thing I want but I know I must do what feels right for me and also as you stressed, let other people do what's right for them. I think its an incredibly exciting time that we live in even with the horrors of climate change, it seems to make sense that it can be reversed if we start to change our own eating habits., Keep creating, I have just come across your blog today and have read one recipe, but I'm a follower already as I needed to hear someone speaking from the heart about this issue., , Many thanks, , , Holly, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Andrea, , says, , , May 15, 2017 at 7:40 pm, , , , Are these meant to be served/eaten warm?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ashley, , says, , , May 15, 2017 at 8:27 pm, , , , Hi, Andrea!

Yes, you can cook and refrigerate them ahead of your event. I'd recommend reheating in the oven at the same temp for maybe 6 to 8 minutes to warm through and crisp back up.

Thanks, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ashley, , says, , , July 17, 2020 at 3:46 pm, , , , Hi, Charisse! The flavor of chickpea flour is quite a bit stronger and earthier than almond flour and the texture is usually a bit grittier, so it's hard for me to recommend without having tested it myself. If you decide to try it and have time to report back, I'd love to know how it goes. If you're looking for a nut-free alternative, sunflower seed flour will work (process raw sunflower seeds in a food processor until ground into a coarse flour texture). Hope this helps!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Rebecca, , says, , , October 01, 2020 at 11:46 am, , , , Help me please! I made these and they tasted amazing but they did not hold together.

Thank you!!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ashley, , says, , , October 02, 2020 at 6:10 am, , , , Hi, Rebecca! Hmm, that is very strange and also tough to problem solve without having been there with you. My best guess would be that the flaxseed meal was either ground too coarse or it was old and not gelatinous enough. It's also possible that the bites weren't packed tight enough before baking. I'm sorry you had that experience\u2014I haven't had anyone report this problem before., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Sara, , says, , , November 13, 2020 at 10:31 am, , , , Hi would these work without yeast?

Nutritional yeast is a really tricky one to substitute in general but especially in these as it's what gives them their cheesy flavor. If you're ok with making regular broccoli bites instead, you can try omitting it altogether. You may need to add a bit more almond meal if they dough is too soft/sticky to form, but other than that it should be straightforward. Hope this helps!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Ashley Kelker, , says, , , December 24, 2021 at 2:24 pm, , , , Delicious!

You could also add onion powder and paprika to the seasoning mix., , Toss, Don\u2019t Drown:, When coating the cauliflower in sauce, make sure every piece gets a bit of flavor, but avoid drenching them. Too much sauce will make the florets mushy and soggy., , Prep Ahead:, You can prepare your cauliflower and sauce ahead of time. Store them separately in the fridge and toss them just before cooking to keep everything fresh. You will need to heat up the hot sauce and give it a good stir before using, , Avoid crowding:, Don\u2019t cram the air fryer basket so to prevent your cauliflower bites from turning soggy. Cook in two batches to ensure adequate airflow around each piece., , Crunch:, If the crunch factor isn\u2019t meeting your expectation, a quick 2-minute re-run in the air fryer should do the trick. Alternatively, a couple of minutes under the broiler works too., , , , Proper Storage, , While cauliflower bites taste best when served immediately, you can refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze them for up to 3 months. To freeze, spread the cooled cauliflower florets on a baking sheet and flash freeze until solid, then transfer to a freezer-safe bag or airtight container.

        "Vegan Spinach Balls": "Ingredients: , I came up with this simple recipe that is a delicious appetizer or snack. My Grandma usually makes these for Thanksgiving and Christmas but I think they are a great appetizer all year around. Spinach is in season in the winter and spring months making it especially great when you can buy fresh spinach locally. That being said, you can also makes these using frozen spinach (check notes on the recipe below for how to). However, I find that the spinach ball burst with more color and flavor when using fresh spinach as opposed to frozen., , I do have to mention one more thing about the color. For some reason it reminds me of \"How the Grinch stole Christmas\". I was so tempeted to call these, Grinch Balls, but realized that no person in their right mind would actually want to eat something called a grinch ball. Sadly, I stuck with boring Vegan Spinach Balls but be my guest to call these grinch balls at next year's, Christmas party :), , These spinach balls are really, easy to make, , , , , Once the mixture is nice and thick, scoop out tablespoon sized balls and bake in the oven until they are nice and brown on the bottom., , , , , , , , , , , , , 4.75, from, 4, votes, , Print, , , , Vegan Spinach Balls, , , Delicious and easy to make Vegan Spinach Balls!

If this is not an option pop them in the microwave for a few seconds to warm up before serving.3) You may use frozen spinach if needed. Allow the spinach to thaw completely and drain it of any excess water before using.4.) If your mixture is too wet to form balls, add more oats or almonds.

Thanks for letting me know. Just fixed it. There a little bit like falafel but the flavor is a bit milder. The cashews give it a bit of a cheesy flavor too.

If you think your food processor can't handle so many nuts at once then you can soak them or just make it in batches.

Thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vanessa Croessmann, , says, , , August 10, 2015 at 12:18 pm, , , , Hi Jenny, I like freezing them before I bake them. Just roll them into balls and then put them in a ziploc bag. When you want to eat them, just let them thaw slighlty and then pop them in the oven. It will take a little bit longer. Just keep a good eye on them in the oven. I think mine took about 30min. Someone else wrote me though once saying they baked them first and the froze them and that that worked out well too. So I guess you can do it either way :), , , Reply, , , , , , , , Jenny D, , says, , , August 10, 2015 at 3:46 pm, , , , That is awesome news!

These are soooo good (my only adjustment was adding a bit of nutritional yeast into the mix). They look and taste so fresh, and they're really getting me through studying for finals right now\u2026might have to eat the whole batch myself. Thanks for the recipe!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vanessa Croessmann, , says, , , December 10, 2015 at 9:43 am, , , , Hi Kierstin, Adding nutritional yeast to these sounds delicious! These spinach balls are definitely addicting. Last time I made them, I tried hogging them but failed miserably. As soon as my boys know we have spinach balls in the house...they are gone. Good luck on your finals!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Ali, , says, , , January 09, 2016 at 2:03 pm, , , , Just wanted to let you know these are amazing I make them all the time and even my husband loves them and asks me to make them!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Katherine, , says, , , March 17, 2016 at 9:55 pm, , , , So I have made these twice now, first time I used breadcrumbs and blah did not work for my taste over seasoned. I am not very good at throughly following a recipe,all about experimenting., , Followed this but with just almonds, all we had on hand. But after baked was told needed more. Was bland, edible but bland. So to eat them we mixed sour cream and sambal, not vegan but neither were the family that were eating them. What could I add? because these can be a hit for everyone's lunch box for work here., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vanessa Croessmann, , says, , , March 19, 2016 at 6:08 pm, , , , Hi Katherine, , , I like experimenting with recipes as well. It's all about the trial, error, and the occasional \"OMG that tastes amazing\" moments. I would definitely give a try with the cashews. They definitely gives these spinach balls more of cheesy and creamy taste. You could also add one or two garlic cloves to the mix and experiment with different seasonings (paprika, cumin, pepper, cayenne pepper, turmeric, etc.)., , , Reply, , , , , , , , David Aldred, , says, , , February 22, 2018 at 4:27 pm, , , , I've finished making some Grinch Balls (hee hee!)  Half of them are in the oven right now; the other half are headed for the freezer.  I've added garlic, dill and thyme to mine \u2026 oh, and black pepper.  I would've added nutritional yeast too, but I've already added it to a herby cauliflower and broccoli bake that I've just frozen, and I'll be serving it all for a meal for my mum at the weekend, with some butter beans in tomato sauce., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , Alison, , says, , , May 04, 2016 at 7:08 pm, , , , , , , I made these yesterday to bring to a friend's family for a Shiva call and all I can say is that they were the talk of the Shiva!  Everyone loved them!  Will be making these again!  I made a double-batch and used chia \"eggs\" and left the nuts a little chunky for some crunch.  Yum!!!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vanessa Croessmann, , says, , , May 09, 2016 at 9:42 am, , , , Thank so much, Alison! I'm so happy everyone enjoyed them. I love these little vegan spinach balls.
