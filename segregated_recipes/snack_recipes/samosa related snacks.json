I want to buy an Airfryer but I am confused between Philips Airfryer and Usha Halogen Oven with airfryer attachment.Heard this oven is good. Any idea?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Rachna, , says, , , May 25, 2015 at 4:29 pm, , , , Thanks, Sharmila. I dislike the market samosa too. So much fat and loaded with unhealthy stuff like Dalda. Makes me sick. I have cursorily read about Usha Halogen Oven. It does not have airfryer attachment. It uses the same airfrying technique. Since it is glass, it looks nicer. It does the same baking, grilling, airfrying that an airfryer does. It has some extra features like cleaning and sterilizing which don't seem spectacular to me. My experience this far with Philips Airfryer has been really good. I should be putting up a review in a few days. Usha seems nice too. I guess, you will have to wait for someone who has actually used the product to review it. \ud83d\ude42 Both these products are much faster than our conventional ovens., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , CookieCrumbs Inc., , says, , , May 25, 2015 at 4:15 pm, , , , Oh, the airfryer sounds too good to be true :/ Does it really banish all the calories that accumulate due to deep frying?

To answer your questions: It does reduce calories because you are only brushing the fat instead of deep frying.  Most dishes I've tried so far taste great. There are exceptions that I'll mention in the post. This samosa is wonderfully tasty but the texture of the outer covering is very different from a conventional samosa. Considering that those are achieved by excessive Dalda, I think this is an option worth exploring., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Bikramjit, , says, , , May 25, 2015 at 5:03 pm, , , , What a coincidence ha ha ha ha guess what .., , I just came back home and I bought some samosa and channa.., , No other way than to buy from the shop..but we have a great shop and they make yum samosa. .., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Rachna, , says, , , May 26, 2015 at 7:27 am, , , , It is quite a time consuming affair.

However, talk of samosas and I can walk that extra mile to have it. There have been times when I have parked my safari near road side stalls to savour the samosas and some gravy curry. It serves as a quick lunch without wasting time as I don't drive during night. So saving time during daytime is very important for me while driving. And I enjoy driving, so I don't drive too fast - just about 100 or 120 kmph. So invariably I keep a watch out for outlets selling samosas. \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Rachna, , says, , , May 29, 2015 at 7:43 am, , , , That is an interesting ode to our favorite snack, Sabyasachi.

        "Air Fried Healthy Samosas": "Ingredients: , To make this recipe, you'll need potatoes, all purpose flour, turmeric, red chili powder, salt, frozen peas and cilantro. You'll also need water for the dough and some vegetable oil to coat the samosa for baking or air-frying. Other spices are totally optional!, , , water, and oil for the samosa dough. Potatoes, peas and some spices for the filling. Technically, you can use almost anything for the filling. My recipe uses the traditional, masala, (potatoes, peas, turmeric, salt and chili powder). The best thing about this is that you can always use any leftover filling on bread as a sandwich and any leftover dough to make Indian flatbread. I'm also working on a cheesy samosa, so stay tuned for that!, , , How to make the perfect baked samosas, , , First, you start by making the potato filling. Have leftover mashed potatoes? Use them right up. Or else, make some, mashed potatoes, , and then add them to a pan with turmeric, red chili powder, salt. Finish with some frozen peas and cilantro.

Stir the spices to evenly coat the potatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes, tasting and adjusting along the way for your preference., Add peas and stir them into the mix for about 30-45 seconds. Turn off the heat, and add a few sprigs of cilantro (if you choose to include them). Transfer to a bowl and set aside., Folding the Samosa (aka, the fun part!), Take the kneaded dough and roll it out into a long cylinder, roughly as long as your two hands side-to-side (~7-8 inches long), Using a knife or sharp edge, portion this cylinder into 8-9 smaller pieces. Take one of the pieces and roll into a smooth ball (while you set the others aside), Now, dust this ball with a bit of flour, and then using a rolling pin, roll it into a circular shape, roughly 6-7 inches in diameter (for reference, the rolled out dough should be slightly larger than the size of your hand), Slice this dough diagonally so you get two (roughly) semi-circular pieces. Pick up one of these pieces and lay it on your left hand so the straight edge lines up against the left side of your hand (it should look like the letter D on your hand)., Wet the straight edge with some water\u00a0and form a cone so that the top is wider and also open for you to stuff\u00a0the filling. Add ~2 heaped teaspoons of filling per samosa and push it in so it evenly fills out (but only till about \u00be of the cone). You might end up adding a bit more depending on how big you rolled the dough out., Note, which you can find in most Indian grocery stores) as well as a half teaspoon of garam masala.

Just make sure to flash freeze them first to avoid them sticking to each other. I've used a 1:1 gluten free mix in place of regular AP flour and it turns out quite well.

Can you make them in an air-fryer?, , It's so easy to bake or air-fry samosas. Three things to keep in mind:, , , Use a slightly higher fat to flour ratio. For instance, here, I use 2 tablespoon of oil per cup of flour, , Add a bit of baking soda to the dough when you knead if you want it ultra crispy (I haven't done that here, but it's an easy option), , Coat them fully with oil and then bake at 400\u00b0F for 35 to 40 minutes, turning over halfway through. Or, to air-fry, put them in at 380\u00b0F for 15 minutes, also turning halfway through., , , What is the difference between air fryer or baked ones and deep fried ones?, , The main difference I noticed between air-fryer or baked samosas and deep fried ones is that the pastry is often not as flaky in the former. A simple trick to ensure extra crispiness is to add a pinch of baking soda when you make the dough. I've also found that AP produces flakier results than using, atta, (i.e. whole wheat flour). That said, you're trading off 5-6 cups of oil for a tablespoon or two when you bake or air-fry samosas. Totally worth it., , , I honestly didn't notice any difference between the baked and air-fried versions. In the picture below, the top part is the baked samosas and the bottom part is the air-fryer samosas. They both tasted just as delicious!, , , , , Can you make gluten-free samosas?, , Yes, you can! So, you can do one of two things to make these gluten free:, , , Use a gluten free flour mix instead of the all purpose flour when making the samosa dough (this gives the closest texture), , Use rice paper wrapper instead of using any flour at all. This obviously has the added advantage of being a lot faster to make, but might not be available in all grocery stores, , , When this quarantine is over, I'll pick up both of these options, and test the recipe again and post any adaptation tips. In the meantime, please let me know if you try a gluten free version and how it goes!, , , , I tend to keep my samosas for a day or two after I've made them. Just like any other pastry, the longer you keep it, the less flaky it gets. I don't recommend eating a samosa 1-2 days after it's been made., , To store,, I wrap them in foil and then reheat them in the oven at 350F for 5-10 minutes if I intend to eat them soon thereafter., , I don't recommend freezing samosas after you've baked them. Instead, make them all the way until the baking step, and then freeze them by placing them on a baking sheet first to flash freeze them. Then you can place them all in a freezer safe container., , , When you have leftover samosas (which I honestly give you props for, we never have any left) - you can break them up and make, samosa chaat, , a delightful Indian street snack., Chaat, uses broken samosas as a base, layered on with yogurt, mint dressing, and if you're in the mood for it, chickpeas (like this delicious, Indian chickpea dip, ).

In the meantime, quarter the potatoes. Once the water has boiled, turn down to medium heat, add potatoes and cover with a lid. Cook for 20-25 minutes until fork inserted goes in smoothly and comes out clean., While potatoes are boiling, prepare samosa dough, Add flour, salt, 1 tablespoon of oil to a mixing bowl and mix using a fork., Slowly add water and knead slowly into a ball. Add \u00bc cup at a time, until the dough falls into a neat ball. If you have a stand mixer, Add a bit of water to the edge of the cone and seal it shut (either by pressing together or folding one edge over the other), If you\u2019re air-frying, after you\u2019re done folding the first samosa, pre-heat to 425 \u00b0F. Depending on the size of your air-fryer, you might need to make a couple of batches \u2013 take care not to overcrowd the samosas since that will prevent the dough from cooking properly, Option 2: Baking Samosa!, If you\u2019re baking samosas, after you're done folding the first samosa, preheat oven to 400, \u00b0F, ., Coat with enough oil to cover all the sides and place aside. Repeat for the rest of the samosas., On a sheet pan lined with a silicon liner or parchment paper, place each samosa roughly 2 inches away from each other, Bake for 20 minutes and check on the color \u2013 if golden brown, flip to the other side and bake for another 10-15 minutes, Remove and serve with ketchup, a nice aioli or a chutney!, Option 1: Air Frying Samosa!, Place the samosas carefully in the air fryer and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, and then flip the sides and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. Depending on your air fryer, you might need to add a few extra minutes. When it's done, the samosas should be crisp on the outside and a nice golden brown color on both sides., Note, : Air fryers are quite different, so the temperatures might vary. Mine takes 18 minutes total to cook. But yours might take longer or shorter depending on the size, power, etc. I suggest checking after 10 minutes to see if one side is done, and then checking again after the 5-7 minutes. You might need to add 5-10 more minutes depending on the fryer!, , Video, , Notes, , Timing is everything for this recipe. Make sure to start by boiling the potatoes; once they\u2019re in the pot, knead the dough and set aside. Once the potatoes are out, make the filling; and by the time the filling is done, you won't regret it!), , You can use phyllo pastry sheets instead of the dough as the base if you don\u2019t want to make the dough from scratch. Also, if you want your samosas to be extra crispy, you can add a pinch of baking soda to the dough., , Depending on the size of your cone, you might need more than just 2 teaspoons of filling. Go with the flow!, , To make a more \"restaurant\" style samosa (versus the version in the main recipe card, which is quite simple and super easy) - I suggest the following spice modifications: once your potatoes are cooked, heat some oil in a skillet and add half a teaspoon each of cumin seeds and black mustard seeds. When they splutter, add a teaspoon each of ginger and garlic paste as well as finely chopped Indian green chili peppers (or jalapenos!) Then, potatoes along with red chili powder, I am sure they would not have turned out as good. I loved your details on how to stuff them and what to exactly do with the dough.

        "Baked Curry Puffs": "Ingredients: onion, and garlic. I like to cut them into tiny bits so they cook down faster plus you can fill more into the pastry., Heat a non-stick pan with oil, and saut\u00e9 onion until translucent. I used red onion for the extra sweetness but regular onion or shallots work just as great. Then, continue to saut\u00e9 carrot and garlic for about 30 seconds or so., Then, stir in the sambal, water or stock and a knotted pandan leaves. Bring the mixture to a rolling boil and lower heat to simmer., Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender and turn off the heat. By this time, the sauce will be slightly thickened and will get thicker when it\u2019s cooled. Then, remove the pandan leaves and stir in the frozen peas. I like to add the frozen peas last to keep the vibrant green., Thaw puff pastry as directed. Mine came with 2 sheets of 9X9 puff pastry. I divided mine into 9 squares on each.

Time varies depending on pastry\u2019s brand, so please bake as directed., Potato, \u2013 I used Russet but any other potatoes such as gold potatoes or sweet potatoes can be used as well., Sambal, \u2013 This, Easy Vegan Sambal, or store-bought sambal works perfectly for this recipe. If you can\u2019t find sambal, you can try subbing with chili sauce and adjust the taste accordingly., Frozen vegetables, \u2013 gave this dish a great color but you can substitute with other vegetables such as chopped broccoli., Puff pastry, \u2013 there are a few brands that do not contain butter, These, baked, curry puffs are, Simple to make and delicious, Easily customizable such as subbing it with a mild potato curry without any heat, Kid\u2019s friendly meal, Perfect for snacks or parties, TASTY!!, Baked Curry Puffs \u2013 \u5496\u55b1\u89d2, , woonheng, A delicious Malaysian snack that are filled with spicy potato filling and wrapped in a flaky puff pastry.
