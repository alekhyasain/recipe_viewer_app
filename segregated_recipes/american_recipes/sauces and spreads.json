I can\u2019t stop eating it. My sauce seemed a bit watery, so I added some nutritional yeast and let it blend for 5 minutes to heat/thicken. I never had the chicken and cheese version but always thought it looked amazing. I am so glad to have this animal free, healthier version!

I hope that helps!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Sariah Gresham, , says, , , April 21, 2023 at 7:20 pm, , , , After blending, my mixture looks much more watery than yours. Is it because I soaked my cashews overnight?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Jess @ IDTLC Support, , says, , , April 28, 2023 at 12:23 pm, , , , If they were rinsed, it shouldn't be too watery but if you like a thicker dip, you can cut the added water down., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Hadley, , says, , , April 29, 2022 at 2:33 pm, , , , Soooo\u2026 I haven\u2019t baked it yet, but can\u2019t stop tasting this sauce\u2014incredibly delicious! I added a quarter cup of nutritional yeast because the Buffalo chicken dip we used to eat before we went vegan had cheddar cheese in it. I can\u2019t believe how good this is and how similar it tastes to the real deal. Wow!

Sam does it again (and again and again) ! Served it with some homemade pita breads and it was sooo good. Next time I won\u2019t cook it so long because I would of preferred it to be runnier and I will double the crispy tofu!

I followed the recipe as written but my tofu came out more crumbled than shredded even though I used a box grater.  I burned my mouth because I wanted to try this so bad. It's spicy, creamy, chewy and delicious.

I actually used a can of white beans instead of cashews to have a more affordable, nut-free option. Also my shredded tofu did get a bit over baked, so I will lessen the baking time or lower the temp next time on making the shredded tofu step, but overall, the dip turned out great!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Sam Turnbull, , says, , , January 02, 2022 at 2:53 pm, , , , So happy you enjoyed it Amanda, and I will have to try it with beans \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Mark, , says, , , December 11, 2021 at 6:58 pm, , , , Just made this for the 4th time.
