        "Butternut Squash Stew": "Ingredients: , I decided to make up my own creation using black beans and butternut squash because I really wanted to put those two things together. I mixed two fall soup/stew staples (butternut squash and black beans) and came up with a tasty recipe that marries the flavors of the two classics. This butternut squash black bean stew is so good and filling!, , This healthy winter squash stew is just what you need when the weather turns cool. The recipe is vegan, gluten free, and filled with warm spices to keep you cozy on a cold night. However, I love to eat hearty stews year-round, and I\u2019ve recently been using this stew as my lunch. As if it needed another appealing point, this stew comes together in a snap!, , SCROLL TO SEE THE RECIPE CARD AT THE END. BUT BEFORE YOU SCROLL CHECK THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE BLURB., , Also, check out, , How To Cook Canned Black Beans, , , Black Bean, And Millet Salad, , and, Quinoa Veggie Bowl., , , Florida Relocation And Black Bean Butternut Squash Stew, , I just want to update my readers about the latest in my journey. We just moved from Ohio to Florida this past week., , I never dreamed of living in Florida, but I couldn\u2019t be happier about this move!, , It is so gorgeous here; we are surrounded by beautiful lakes and lovely tropical scenery. I\u2019m still pinching myself., , I must say I really enjoy being a missionary\u2019s wife; we get to live in some of the most beautiful countryside., , I will be sharing photos as soon as I\u2019m more settled. Our dog Macho did very well on the long ride, and he was very calm throughout our 13-hour drive., , We stopped part of the way for a night so that it wasn\u2019t too much for my daughter, who drove one of our vehicles., , We are still waiting for May Flower to deliver our belongings, but fortunately, we are staying in a fully furnished home while our future home is being renovated., , Comforting Black Bean Butternut Stew, , Although I miss my friends in Ohio, I\u2019m always excited to make new friends and see what God has in store for us., , My husband loves his new job as manager of a much larger facility for the same organization, my daughter was fortunate to get a job transfer, and Daevyd can\u2019t wait to meet new friends., , I will have to take a little break from soap-making until I\u2019m all settled, but I will continue to share recipes with you. I\u2019m overjoyed on being able to grow tropical fruits and vegetables here. I am eager to begin my garden., In a nearby health food store, I purchased some lovely collard greens that were so vibrant and tender. I added some to this butternut squash and black beans, , This black bean stew reminds me of my, Brazilian Black Bean Stew, , recipe,, Lentil Stew, ,, Yellow Yam Stew, ,, and, Chickpea Stew, , which are so flavorful., , Why Should You Try This Stew?, , , This Black Bean Butternut Squash Stew is so easy, satisfying, and delicious., , It\u2019s an ideal weeknight meal that comes together quickly and packs a lot of flavors., , I love the combo of black beans, butternut squash, and collard greens in this stew because it has such a nice balance of flavors and textures. The stew is thickened with coconut milk and flavored with garlic, cayenne pepper, and Italian seasoning for a nice flavor kick., , It is a healthy, vegetarian dish. Black beans give this stew a lot of protein, vitamins, and minerals without adding many calories. The butternut squash gives it some extra nutrition., , This recipe makes about 6 servings, so it\u2019s great for leftovers too!, , , , , , Coconut Oil:, I use coconut oil. Coconut oil was chosen because of the numerous health benefits it provides. If you don\u2019t have coconut oil, olive or avocado oil will work., , Onion, \u2013 Gives flavor to your beans. Yellow, white, or red onions work great in this recipe., , Red Bell Pepper:, Red bell pepper offers a citrusy and sweet flavor. They add beautiful colors. If you want your dish to be visually more appealing, you can use red, yellow, and green peppers., , Garlic:, Garlic is an essential ingredient in almost every savory dish, and the same is the case with this stew. It brings in an intense savory flavor which makes this stew more tasteful. I added 3 cloves for maximum flavor., , Green onion:, You get a grassy yet savory flavor by adding green onion., , Butternut Squash:, Butternut squash is the main ingredient in this stew. Butternut squash, like pumpkin, is a winter vegetable. It has a matte beige exterior and a dark orange inside. Butternut squash is widely available in supermarkets. Make sure to use fresh produce. It was peeled, split in half, deseeded, and chopped equally into \u00bd inch cubes., , Black beans, : You can use cans of black beans or dried ones. Sort through the debris and discard any broken dry black beans. Soak black beans for eight hours or overnight in water after rinsing. The next day, drain the water from the pot, but keep the black beans there and top them off with fresh water, approximately an inch above the beans\u2019 surface. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the flame to low heat and let it simmer for about 40 minutes. Alternatively, , make Instant Pot Black Beans, ., , Tender collard greens:, Kale would be an excellent substitute for the collard greens\u2013 or if you can\u2019t eat kale for any reason, try a handful of spinach instead!, , Coconut Milk, \u2013 Coconut milk is an essential component of this stew and many other Jamaican dishes. Coconut milk gives a creamy texture to this stew. You can substitute coconut milk with unsweetened soymilk or any other plant-based milk., , , The Seasonings, , , Italian seasoning:, Italian seasoning is a dried herb blend that gives this stew taste as well as aroma., , Thyme, \u2013 A must ingredient for this black bean butternut squash stew. Gives a lovely earthy flavor. If you do not have fresh thyme, you can use \u00bd teaspoon of dried thyme instead., , Vegetable Broth:, You can use any broth you have on hand and even make your own with vegetable peelings. If you are not vegan, you can use beef or chicken broth for a more rich and deep flavor. You can use water if you don\u2019t have any broth on hand., , Vegan bouillon cubes:, These cubes are magical. They are made from vegetable stock and have a savory umami flavor. Adding bouillons means you don\u2019t have to worry about adjusting the flavors of this stew. It is a shortcut to perfect taste. I used Edward & Son\u2019s Not-Chick\u2019n Bouillon Cubes., , Cayenne pepper:, I have used cayenne pepper to get a bit of heat from this stew.

Not only that, but it\u2019s just as yummy and cozy as the ones I remember eating in my childhood., , , What You Need for Vegan Pot Pie, , There are just 4 main components when it comes to making a great pot pie:, , , , Pie crust:, I opted to use my, Vegan Pie Crust Recipe, , but feel free to use another homemade pie crust or your favorite store-bought brand. If making my homemade recipe, make sure to, double the recipe, \u2013 one crust for the bottom, and one for the top., , Creamy sauce:, Traditional pot pies are typically made with heavy cream or canned soups. Instead, we\u2019re making a healthy, homemade sauce from non-dairy milk, nutritional yeast, and chickpea flour., , Fresh veggies:, I like to keep things classic and use celery, peas, carrots, and gold potatoes for a nice and hearty bite. If you\u2019re short on time or prefer to make things even easier, use a frozen blend of mixed vegetables with green beans., , Seasonings:, Most of the nostalgic flavor and aroma in a classic pot pie can be attributed to the spices and seasoning. All that\u2019s required for this mouth-watering effect is freshly chopped thyme, smoked paprika, and freshly cracked black pepper., , , How to Make Vegan Pot Pie, , , , , Par-bake, , Whisk, , Leftover pot pie will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator. When storing, tightly cover the pot pie with a layer of plastic wrap or aluminum foil, or transfer slices to an airtight container. Leftovers reheat best in the toaster oven or oven, covered with foil, but can be reheated in a pinch., , Freezing vegetarian pot pie is also possible, but is difficult to do without the crust becoming soggy and/or taking forever to bake from frozen.

Or, make my quick and easy, No-Boil Chickpea Noodle Casserole, for a fun twist on the classic recipe., , , What replaces chicken in vegan pot pie?, , In this particular recipe, the classic chicken is replaced with wholesome, plant-based chickpeas. They\u2019re a great source of protein and have just the right hearty texture. Some readers have also shared success making this pot pie using hydrated soy curls. If you\u2019re an experienced home-cook, feel free to experiment and find your favorite vegan protein alternative., , , I am preparing this vegan pot pie for a holiday.

If the crust is already golden brown at that point, then loosely tent it with foil to prevent it from burning and continue baking. If it\u2019s not golden yet, continue baking without foil and check every 5 minutes, tenting with foil only if it starts to brown too much. This ensures the crust gets perfectly golden without burning.

The roast was delicious! My son who carefully critiques my cooking said, \"Mom, you hit it out of the ballpark!\" After we had dinner, I found him slicing another piece for a sandwich. The next morning he grilled some onions, added a slice on top and covered it with a lid to warm it up. He then added it to some toast with fixings (spinach and tomato). He's a big fan and so am I. This recipe will be our go-to for future family celebrations! Thank you Vegan Huggs!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Melissa Huggins, , , December 19, 2024 at 12:38 pm, , , , Hi Michelle, this made my day!

You can toss the remaining liquid. \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , , , EJL, , says, , , May 09, 2022 at 6:37 am, , , , You can also freeze any leftover aquafaba in an ice cube tray, (good to do 2 or 3 tbsp per cube section -since 2 tbsp is the equivalent of 1 egg white and 3 tbsp is the equivalent of 1 whole egg). Pop them out the next day and wrap them in plastic wrap, then in a (labeled) zipper plastic bag or freezer safe container. Then if you have a recipe that uses aquafaba, but not chickpeas, you're ready to go.  The cubes are pretty easy to thaw in a little dish at room temp (don't microwave them to thaw), , , Reply, , , , , , , , Linda & Alex, , says, , , May 09, 2022 at 10:28 pm, , , , Great tips, thank you!, , , , , , , , , , , , , Shenita, , says, , , December 24, 2021 at 10:45 am, , , , Linda, oh my delicious!

I don't like the one's that are mushy, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Linda Meyer, , says, , , February 18, 2021 at 8:57 pm, , , , Hi Lori,, , This is not mushy at all, as long as you bake it until it's done and let it set in the pan as instructed. Ovens can be calibrated differently, the humidity or the amount of liquid in the beans can make a difference in the moisture level of the loaf. This is why we recommend using a long wooden skewer to test the loaf. If it comes out clean, it's done, if not, bake it another 10 minutes and test again. Also Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (176\u02daC) and line a 9\u201d bread pan with parchment paper or grease the pan., Heat a large skillet on medium heat and add the oil or the 2 tablespoons of vegetable broth if you don\u2019t cook with oil. When the oil or broth is hot add the onions and reduce the heat to medium-low. Stir well. Add 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste, stir well, and cook until the onions are soft and translucent. Don\u2019t let them brown. Approximately five minutes., Add the 2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, \u00bdcup of vegetable broth, and \u2153 cup of ketchup to the onions and stir until the ketchup dissolves. Set aside., Process the 15 oz of drained and rinsed (reserve the liquid) chickpeas in a food processor until creamy. Put in a large bowl., Process 15 oz of drained and rinsed black beans in the processor until creamy. Put in the bowl with the chickpeas., Pulse the remaining 15 oz of drained and rinsed black beans until lightly ground into small pieces. Put in the bowl with the chickpeas and other can of black beans., Process the 1 cup of rolled oats until it turns into a course flour. Add to the bowl with the beans., Add the 1 cup of cornmeal, 3 tablespoon of liquid smoke, and add half of the \u00bd cup of aquafaba to the bowl with the beans. If the mixture is too dry once you mix everything together, add 1 tablespoon of broth or water to the mixture and stir. Add more as needed., the size of the loaf pan will definitely alter the cook time., , Additionally, when you're making the batter, if it feels too wet, add a little more cornstarch until it sticks together. If it feels to dry and crumbly, add a little more aquafaba or water until it becomes sticky., , We hope this helps you make a great loaf. It's one of our most popular recipes and overwhelmingly loved by our readers. \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Denise C., , says, , , December 08, 2021 at 4:04 am, , , , I think you meant you should add more flour rather than cornstarch if the batter is too wet.

LOL! Way too much sauce over the top - followed the measurements, but still wound up with so much that most of it just tasted like BBQ! Oops #1. #2 was...too much cornmeal. Very dense, and dry. Salvageable, though. Oops #3 - I have a small propane stove. Its thermometer is obviously WAY off. 350\u00b0F for 1 hour 20 minutes? Nope. Let's go 20 more. Still no. Turned up the temp and went for 15 - DON'T EVER DO THIS!!!, , Oh well, live and learn, and like I said, it's all salvageable. Cut it thin, baste with a little low-sodium veggie broth in the microwave for a minute, or back in the oven at whatever that actual temperature is for about 10-15 while basting, and it's all good. Or, cut it into thick chunks and toss it into fried rice! It won't go to waste, and next time? I'm having a calibrated thermometer and cutting back on the sauce and cornmeal!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Linda Meyer, , says, , , January 02, 2021 at 5:52 pm, , , , Oh my! Thank you for the 5 star review, especially after all of that! LOL! Baking any kind of loaf is tricky, because of so many variables. I'm happy you were able to salvage it and enjoyed the flavor and texture. \ud83d\ude42, , , Reply, , , , , , \u00ab Older Comments, , , , 3.98 from 177 votes (, 169 ratings without comment, ), , , , Leave a Reply, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , Recipe Rating, , , , Recipe Rating, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Comment, *, , Name, *, , , Email, *, , , , , , I have read and accepted the, Privacy Policy, *, , , , , , , Notify me of followup comments via e-mail.

You won\u2019t believe just how much it tastes like the real thing, tangy, , smoky, meaty, and satisfying. AND it doesn\u2019t take 8 hours to make, win-win! The secret ingredient is jackfruit, a, tropical fruit that has a meaty, heavy-grained flesh similar to pork. It absorbs the flavors of smoke and BBQ sauce, beautifully and comes out tasting just like the real deal. We use the canned variety here, which you can find at most Asian markets or order, online. It\u2019s important to use the young, unripe fruit for this, so be careful if buying fresh, as most fresh fruits are sold ripened., 3 cans, young green jackfruit in brine (NOT, (20-oz. each) \tin syrup), drained, rinsed, cored, , and seeds removed and discarded, 1 Tbsp., extra-virgin organic coconut oil, 1 cup, \u0007chopped onion, (approx. 1\u00bd medium), 5 cloves, garlic, finely chopped, 2 tsp., coconut sugar, 1 tsp., ground cumin, 1 tsp., ground coriander, 2 tsp., chili powder, 2 tsp., ground smoked paprika, \u00bc tsp., instant espresso powder, \u00bc tsp., unsweetened cocoa powder, \u00bc tsp., ground cinnamon, \u00bc tsp., ground allspice, \u00bd tsp., ground black pepper, \u00bd tsp., \u0007smoked sea salt (or Himalayan salt), \u00bc tsp., \u0007ground cayenne pepper (optional), 2 cups, low-sodium organic vegetable broth, \u00bd cup, Banana BBQ Sauce (see separate, recipe for Banana BBQ Sauce) or, all-natural barbecue sauce of, your choice, SPECIAL EQUIPMENT:, Aluminum foil (optional), 1 cup wood chips for smoking (optional), Parchment paper, 1. \t If you would like to pre-smoke your jackfruit, line bottom of large stock, pot with aluminum foil.

My pizza dough recipe uses 2 1/2 cups of flour which makes 2 pizza doughs.

Instead of tomato sauce, I smeared just a tad of bbq sauce on the crust first.  My cheese didn't come out very gooey though, did I not cook it long enough?  It spread fairly easily; I used my fingers to push it around toward the edges and I didn't add the extra 1/3 cup of water to the blender.  I topped with shallots (out of red onions?!).  I know I'll be making this again using the cheese but sure would like to find a way to get that mozzy stretch out of it!

I would definitely add the extra 1/3 cup of water which will not only help the cheese spread more but it will help it from drying out too much in the oven so it will hopefully maintain the stretchiness.

        "Slow cooker 3 bean vegetarian chili": "Ingredients: , Growing up the chili my mom made never had meat in it, she filled it with a ton of vegetables and flavors, it wasn\u2019t until I was older that I realized that a lot of people will typically make chili with meat., , So I relied on my memory of what my mom made along with what I thought would taste good, here is what happened:, , Texture, : I really wanted to make sure that my vegetarian chili had the right consistency, some (not all) tend to not have a lot of structure. So I ended up adding not 1 or 2 types of beans but 3.

I absolutely love this recipe it\u2019s on my meal plan list. However I want to try adding some meat in it for extra protein. Have you tried making it with ground beef?

Thanks so much!!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Lauren Schmidt, , says, , , March 15, 2024 at 11:12 am, , , , I think the addition of ground beef would work really well, although I haven\u2019t tried it personally.

Thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Lauren Schmidt, , says, , , August 19, 2024 at 10:59 am, , , , This isn\u2019t that soupy, it is more thick like a chili. The veggies all release quite a bit of liquid so the end result isn\u2019t too thick but if you like a more soupy chili feel free to add broth or tomato juice to make it soupier., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Tracy, , says, , , September 2, 2024 at 11:00 am, , , , This is a family favorite.

        "Mushroom Bourguignon": "Ingredients: , since I\u2019m all about healthy and plant-based foods, but not all about lacking flavor, while garlic, onion powder, and fresh thyme ensure that the taste of this dish is unforgettable., , , , Mushrooms, \u2013 Used in place of meat and prepared to be a highlight of flavor within the dish., , Vegetable Broth, \u2013 Used in place of beef broth to give that classic bourguignon flavor while maintaining the cruelty-free aspect., , Peas, \u2013 The addition of multiple vegetables gives an array of flavor points within the dish and only makes it more nutrient-dense and protein-rich., , Plant-Based Milk, \u2013 Perfect for making a dish creamy without worrying about dairy., , , Check the, recipe card below, amounts, etc., , , How to Make Vegan Mushroom Bourguignon?, , STEP 1:, Prepare your mushrooms and potatoes by soaking dried mushrooms then peeling and chopping potatoes before placing them in a pot to boil., , STEP 2:, Once potatoes are finished, , , STEP 3:, Heat oil in a pan and saut\u00e9 the onions for a few minutes before adding in the mushrooms, carrots, peas, garlic, thyme, and the rest of the spices.

However, if you enjoy the taste of sweet potatoes, it can be a delicious change., , Other plant-based milk options in the mashed potatoes, \u2013 Any plant-based milk option is definitely fine to use. However, coconut milk is higher in fat content which means it will be creamier than options such as almond milk, oat milk, etc. In order to counteract this, simply add a tablespoon of oil or vegan butter., , How to Store, \u2013 This mushroom bourguignon should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
