Unfortunately, while I was making it I ate 1/3 of the bag of cashews.  That wasn\u2019t good but besides that everyone (a miracle in my house) seemed to like it.  My only complaint is it didn\u2019t make anywhere near enough.  I increased the rice because we have a family of 5 but it still wasn\u2019t enough.  I\u2019ll have to double it next time.
