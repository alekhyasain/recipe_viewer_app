recipe, with step by step photo and video recipe. indian street food is popular not only in india, but all over over the world for its full of flavour and spice level. one such fusion cuisine is the famous indo chinese cuisine in which manchuri recipes are king of it. manchuri recipe can be made with combination of vegetables or with deep fried bread balls for, bread manchurian recipe, ., , in this recipe, i have basically adapted my previous, cabbage\u00a0manchurian, and i have replaced the veggie balls with bread balls. while i was preparing i personally felt this recipe is much easier to prepare as compared to the former. also the deep fried snacks were more tastier as compared to deep fried veggie balls. hence my vote is certainly for this bread-based recipe. however deep frying the bread can be tricky and it may perhaps absorb more oil, if it is not shaped firmly and properly. but the rule of thumb for me is, whenever the bread meets hot oil, the result is always amazing. you name it, bread rolls, , , bread pakora, and, bread vada, are always popular choice., , , while the recipe is fairly easy to prepare, yet some easy tips and suggestions for, bread manchurian, . firstly, i would heavily recommend to use the traditional white sandwich bread slices as compared to the brown or wholemeal bread. basically plain flour based bread are more easy to shape and less accidents while deep frying. secondly, if you do not wish to deep fry these bread balls, you can even pan fry / bake or shallow fry too. in addition you can even use appe pan to fry these balls with a half tsp of oil in in each appe, mould, . lastly, i have prepared the dry version of manchuri, it can also be prepared with gravy too. refer my, gobi manchurian gravy recipe, for more info about the gravy., , finally do visit my other, indo chinese street food recipes collection, with this post of, bread manchurian recipe, . it includes recipes like, gobi manchurian, , , paneer chilli, , , veg
