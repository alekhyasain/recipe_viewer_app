I did use a large wok and did that in one sitting.   I followed the advise of using tongs to turn over each piece.  That was really good advise and our end product was so good.

My partner also couldn\u2019t eat it. Could this be because I soaked the aubergine in either too much salt or for too long? I did rinse the aubergines but perhaps they retained the salt? I have low sodium soy so don\u2019t think it was that. Any tips as I want to make this again.

The only thing I can think of, especially since you used low sodium soy sauce, is that you may have over-reduced the sauce? That would make it salty.

It is an acquired taste, and now I actually love it.

I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see this, but just in case you do, or if someone else is looking for the same answer, you can blend 2 to 2 1/2 cup of water (depending on how thick you want your \u201ccream\u201d to be) with 2/3 cup of oats and a pinch of salt.  Add some imitation coconut baking extract, if you still want that flavor.  Depending on whether, or not, you have a high speed blender, you may want to strain your oat cream to remove any remaining bits.

Then add the diced potatoes. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper., Saute the potatoes, reducing heat as needed until they are starting to brown and have softened a bit. About 5-7 minutes., Next, add the remaining 1/4 cup of vegan butter, the lentils, garlic, ginger and shallots. Saute for another minute or so until the shallots are translucent., Now, add the tomato sauce, vegetable broth, coconut milk, lemon juice, all the spices and the agave. Stir to combine., Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally until the potatoes are soft and cooked through. The sauce will get nice and thick., Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings. Serve immediately over basmati rice.
