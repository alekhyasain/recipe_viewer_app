Rinse off the excess starch by running cold water over the rice until the water runs clear. If you skip this step, the excess starch will cause the rice to stick together and become mushy when cooking., Amount of liquid., Having too much water or sauce added to the rice while cooking also makes it mushy.

It was probably closer to 4 cups of rice. I subbed asparagus for the mushrooms and it was really good!, , , , , , , , Sophie, \u2014, March 26, 2021 @ 2:01 pm, , Reply, , , , , , Super easy and came out great! I used a bag of frozen brown rice from Trader Joe\u2019s and it was too much sauce for the amount of rice so next time I\u2019ll halve the amount of sauce.

It came out super salty and just didn\u2019t have enough rice. It would turn out wonderful if I just added more rice., , , , , , , , , , Simone, \u2014, November 5, 2021 @ 2:42 am, , Reply, , , , , , I was super stocked to try this recipe because it looked super easy. I substituted coconut amino for the low sodium soy sauce and added bean sprouts.I agree with others too much sauce for the rice and the flavor profiles were just meh! Not what I expected tastes like it\u2019s missing something! Also cilantro topper on this dish is not a good garish, flavors are all wrong., , , , , , , Leave a comment \u00bb, , , , , , , , , , , , Nice to Meet You!, , I\u2019m Rene!
