Marinate for 10-15 minutes., In a small bowl, stir together rice vinegar, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Ketchup and cornstarch. Set aside., Heat a large frying pan over high heat. Add 1 tbsp oil. Arrange the tofu strips in a single layer. Let it cook undisturbed on medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes.  Flips the strips and let it crisp on the other side.  The tofu strips should look brown and crisp on both sides., Remove and place on a kitchen towel/tissue paper to absorb extra oil., In the same pan add remaining oil. Once it is hot add in garlic, ginger, and red chili flakes. Fry over low heat for about 10-15 seconds, or until aromatic, taking care not to burn the garlic., Increase the flame and add Sliced onion. Saute over high heat for a minute. Add red bell pepper and toss in high flame for about 1 minute. Make sure to stir and toss the vegetables well., Add the crisp tofu strips followed by the prepared sauce. Toss everything well.

I look forward to more. I\u2019d like to point out however, that whatever editing programme you are using is putting capital letters on almost everything. Although that is an error in English, most of the time it is harmless. However in the case of distinguishing teaspoons and tablespoons it might cause user errors. The short form of teaspoon is tsp. The shortform of tablespoon is T. These have been the norms for decades and were developed to avoid confusion. Capital T is always big. Small t is always small.

        "Kung pao cauliflower": "Ingredients: , , , , How To Make Kung Pao Cauliflower?, , This recipe has only 8 steps which are easy to follow and not complicated at all. First, you allow the cauliflower a nice cozy bath in a batter made from chickpea flour, cornstarch, soy sauce, and water. While the cauliflower florets bake in the oven you can fry the bell pepper, garlic, fresh ginger and peppercorns in a skillet. Your kitchen will smell amazing!, , bring to a boil, and allow it to simmer for one minute., , Finally, add the roasted cauliflower to the skillet and give it a good stir. You can enjoy it right away. However, if you want the cauliflower to be crispy, transfer it back to the oven for a further 10-15 minutes! Check the easy instruction pictures below:, , , What about Kung Pao Tofu?, , This spicy Kung Pao can be made with either cauliflower or tofu. I don\u2019t eat tofu very often but if you want your Kung Pao to be packed with lots of plant-based protein you can use tofu., How to make Kung Pao Tofu?, , you will need to press the tofu for about 15-20 minutes, slice it into cubes and fry it in a pan until nicely brown. You can try out both versions and let me know which one you preferred. \ud83d\ude42, , , Spicy Kung Pao, , Do you love spicy food? I know it\u2019s super, healthy, and I like spicy food as long as it\u2019s not too spicy. Yesterday I ate a whole dried chili (yes, the whole chili with the seeds) and almost fainted, haha. It was too much for my tastebuds. You can make this Kung Pao with 4-6 dried chilies which you can fry with the garlic, ginger, peppercorns, and bell pepper., , However, I would suggest removing the chilies before you pour in the sauce. If you don\u2019t have dried chilies, simply use 1/4 teaspoon (or more) cayenne pepper. Not a fan of spicy meals? Leave it out completely for a mild Kung Pao Cauliflower., , , Does it keep?, , Yes! Leftovers can be stored covered in the fridge for up to 4 days. Simply reheat in a pan/skillet., , , You Will Love This Kung Pao Cauliflower.

The chickpea flour is such a great choice for the batter and they came out perfectly crisped but a little firm.

All you need to do is, , This recipe has a, video, Batter:, Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl whisk together cornstarch, chickpea flour, plant-based milk, and soy sauce. Let it sit for about 1 minute, then add the cauliflower florets., Toss until all cauliflower florets are coated with batter. Transfer the cauliflower to the prepared baking sheet and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, Skillet:, Heat oil (or water) in a skillet over low to medium heat, add garlic, ginger, peppercorns. Saute for 1 minute, stirring frequently to avoid burning., Next, add bell pepper and saute with a lid on for a further 5-6 minutes, stirring frequently. Add more water if necessary (I used 1 tbsp)., Sauce:, Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. In a medium/large bowl, combine water, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, smoked paprika, and cayenne. Whisk., Pour the sauce into the skillet. Bring to a boil and let simmer on low heat for 1 minute.

Garnish with sesame seeds, fresh chives and peanuts (optional). Enjoy!, , , Notes, , Chickpea flour alternative, : I would suggest using gluten-free all-purpose flour (or regular flour if not gluten-free) instead of chickpea flour (haven't tried it out though)., , Soy sauce, : Use gluten-free if needed or tamari or coconut aminos. You can also use low-sodium soy sauce., , Sweetener, : You can use a sweetener of choice, e.g. maple syrup, coconut sugar, brown sugar, etc., , Use 1/4 teaspoon (or more) of cayenne pepper OR 4-6 dried chilies instead. If you prefer dried chilies, add them to the pan and fry together with garlic, ginger, peppercorns, and bell pepper. Then remove the chilies before you pour in the sauce, otherwise, the Kung Pao will be too spicy!, , Make sure to also check out my, Sticky Teriyaki Tofu, recipe., , Recipe serves 2.

        "Gobi Pepper Fry": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make gobi pepper fry with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , gobi pepper fry recipe | cauliflower pepper fry | gobi pepper dry, with step by step photo and video recipe. gobi based recipes or particularly cauliflower snacks are super popular across india. it is typically used as a meat alternative and used mainly in the indo chinese manchurian and chilli recipes. yet it is also used in other south indian variants and the gobi pepper fry recipe is one such popular snack that inherits the spice level from chettinad cuisine., , indo chinese recipes have always been my all-time favourite snack meal recipe. it is mainly due to the combination of flavour and taste it has to offer in each bite. the main reason to mention about indo chinese in this south indian recipe post is to acknowledge the fact that, it has been derived from it. generally, indian cuisine does not use cornflour in its snacks recipes. but this recipe does use cornflour to get the crisp texture, very similar to indo chinese. later it is used in a south indian tadka which makes it unique and native to south india. in other words, the combination of onions, garlic and fresh herbs makes it native to south india., , , , , , , furthermore, some more important tips, suggestions and variants to the, gobi pepper fry recipe, . firstly, i would always recommend using fresh and tender cauliflower for any kind of gobi snacks recipe. this would make it crispier, juicier and also tastier with the final recipe. secondly, the combination of cornflour and maida used in this recipe should be ideal to get a crunchy and crispy gobi pakora. but if you need crispier you can add more cornflour to make it even crispier. lastly, once the deep-, fried, process is done, it should be immediately used for tempering., , finally, i request you to visit my other related, snacks recipes collection, with this post of, gobi pepper fry recipe, . it mainly includes my other related recipes like, potato murukku, , , crispy veg starter, , , macaroni kurkure, , , onion samosa, , , railway cutlet, , , aloo papdi, , , roti tacos, , , palak patra, , ,

Thank you so much, , Astrid: Soooo Yummy. I made this for dinner a few nights ago and will be making this again soon. I added some green beans and served it over rice noodles.

Thank you., , Cillian: This is such a good, simple recipe when you want something tasty but don't want to be cooking for ages!

Served it over jasmine rice with baby spinach wilted with garlic, sesame oil and soy sauce. Thank you!, , , Jump to:, , Tofu., For this recipe, where the tofu is the centerpiece and gets cooked and coated with a rich sauce, you will need firm or extra firm tofu. If you are getting tofu fresh from an Asian supermarket, you may need to get the extra firm type. They tend to be softer than the tofu you can buy at your regular supermarket., , Peanut Butter, . We use toasted peanut butter as it has a deeper flavor. Choose a smooth peanut butter that uses just one ingredient: Peanuts., , Coconut Milk., To get the perfect creaminess of the sauce, we add coconut milk to the mixture. You can also use cashew cream or another vegetable milk or cream., , Sambal Oelek, . We use, Sambal Oelek, for the spicy touch, but if you prefer a milder sauce, you can skip this ingredient or add \u00bd teaspoon of chili flakes instead. You can substitute this ingredient for sriracha or another chili paste or sauce. If you are making this dish for young kids or toddlers, skip this!, , Shallot, . Shallots or yellow onion give the sauce the perfect sweetness., , Ginger, . Use fresh or, dried ginger, ., , Soy Sauce or Tamari, . To balance the sweetness from the sauce, we like adding some soy sauce or, tamari, for a gluten-free option., , Lime juice., The last and really important ingredient is lime juice, which adds some tanginess to the sauce., , , , , , Stirfry for 2-3 minutes and add the coconut milk., , , Add the peanut butter and mix well., , , Add the sambal, lime juice, and soy sauce., , , , All you need to do now is add, combine the pan-fried tofu with the spicy peanut sauce and serve with some rice or noodles, or prepare a hearty tofu bowl., , , , , , Tofu with Spicy Peanut Sauce, , , Our Tofu served with a Spicy Peanut Sauce is creamy, rich, nutty, vegan, and gluten-free, the perfect weeknight dinner or appetizer., , , 4.50, from, 16, votes, , , Print, , Pin, , Rate, , , Course:, Appetizer, Main Course, Cuisine:, asian, Keyword:, Tofu with Spicy Peanut Sauce, , Prep Time:, 5, minutes, , minutes, Cook Time:, 20, minutes, , minutes, Total Time:, 25, minutes, , minutes, , Servings:, 4, , people, , Calories:, 283, kcal, , , \u25a2, 14, , oz, , firm tofu, \u25a2, 1, , shallot, \u25a2, 1, , thumb-sized piece ginger, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , coconut milk, \u25a2, \u00bc, , cup, , peanut butter, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tablespoon, , Sambal Oelek, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tablespoon, , soy sauce, \u25a2, Juice of \u00bd lime, US Customary, -, Metric, , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark, , 1 shallot, , 1 thumb-sized piece ginger, Heat some coconut or vegetable oil in a saucepan and add the shallot and ginger.

We have been cooking this protein in different ways, and our favorite way is to fry the tofu in a pan with a little bit of vegetable or sesame oil. Pan-frying the tofu at a medium-low temperature while you keep turning the tofu pieces to cook each side is a perfect way, in our opinion, to cook it., , It gets golden and crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. It may take a bit longer than baking or deep frying it, but it's definitely worth it., , , Remove any excess of water from the tofu with a paper towel, gently pressing the block.

The flavors of the sticky sauce were so perfect; My husband is not very tolerant of hot spicy foods, so I did only add 1 teaspoon of the sambal and then my son and I added more to our individual dishes. We also added a red bell pepper during the last 10 minutes of roasting the sprouts, because we needed to use them and that was another fresh addition. The only complaint at the table was they wished there was even more sticky sauce so next time I might double the sauce and serve the extra at the table.

I had my usual bad luck trying to stir-fry tofu, so next time I will do what I usually do\u2013I\u2019ll marinate and bake the tofu (no starch) and then add it at step 11. I didn\u2019t include the maple syrup in the marinade, only in the stir-fry sauce, and found the result perfectly balanced.

I would rather have this than take out.  I only made some slight modifications.  My husband likes things saucy so I doubled the sauce and used a 16 oz block of super firm tofu  I ended up using about 2/3 to 3/4 of the sauce. I also used red chili flakes in place of the Thai red chilis.  Lastly, I cut back the ginger just a little as I am not a fan of strong ginger flavors. I sprinkled the top with the sliced onion bulbs and chopped peanuts. I served this alongside seasoned and roasted green beans.

Cook the rice on the, stovetop, , in the, Instant Pot, , or in a rice cooker. Steam the broccoli in a, steamer basket, set over boiling water for ~4-6 minutes. Otherwise, move onto the next step., Drain tofu and wrap it in a clean, absorbent towel. Set something heavy on top to absorb excess moisture, such as a, cast iron skillet, (or use a, tofu press, ). Let rest for about 10 minutes., Prep/chop green onions, garlic, and ginger at this time. Set aside., While tofu is pressing, prepare stir-fry sauce by combining sesame oil, cornstarch, minced garlic, minced ginger, rice vinegar, maple syrup, tamari or soy sauce, and water in a small mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed (I left mine as is)., Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet (mine is 10\u201d) over medium heat. In the meantime, unwrap tofu and cut into even pieces, about 3/4-inch cubes (see photo)., Add tofu to a shallow mixing bowl (see photo) and top with 3 Tbsp tamari or soy sauce, 1 tsp chili garlic sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil, and 1 Tbsp maple syrup (adjust amounts if altering number of servings // DO NOT ADD CORNSTARCH AT THIS TIME). Toss to combine. Let rest 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally., Use a slotted spoon or fork to transfer tofu to a quart-size or large freezer bag (or tupperware container), leaving the remaining marinade behind (can be drizzled over rice and broccoli for serving). Add cornstarch 1 Tbsp at a time and toss to coat. Continue adding more cornstarch and tossing until tofu is coated in a gummy, white layer \u2013 about 4-5 Tbsp (adjust amount if altering number of servings)., To the hot skillet, add 2 Tbsp neutral oil (adjust amount if altering number of servings) and let warm for 30 seconds. Then use a slotted spoon or fork to add tofu to the pan (leaving any excess cornstarch behind)., Cook tofu on all sides for ~1 minute, or until light golden brown. You don\u2019t want it blackened or burned, as you\u2019ll be cooking it again later with the sauce. Aim for a consistent golden brown crust (see photo). Remove tofu from pan as it\u2019s finished browning. Set aside., NOTE: If you prefer firmer / crispier tofu, , option at this time to transfer tofu to a 375 degree F (190 C) oven in a cast iron pan or parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes (or more) to dry it out. This will create a firmer, chewier tofu in the final dish. However, it does make it more than a 30 minute recipe., Return skillet to burner and increase heat to medium-high. Add 1 Tbsp sesame oil (adjust amount if altering number of servings), chopped green onions, and dried red chilies. Saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently., Add the sauce and tofu. Cook, stirring frequently, to coat the tofu and vegetables for 1-2 minutes, or until warmed through and the sauce has slightly thickened (see photo)., Remove pan from heat and add sesame seeds (optional). Toss to coat., Serve with rice and steamed broccoli (optional), or other desired sides. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep for 2-3 days in the refrigerator.

Thanks for the feedback! I made this recipe multiple times before posting it here. no one else seems to have this issue with the amount of water. Can I ask how much water you needed to use to make it into a batter? Was it more than 1/3 cup? the reason I listed a range (1/4-1/3 cup) because flours can differ in texture so some might be dryer or tougher to thin out.

I would recommend battering each piece separately and then frying individually (as in, not touching in the pan). I have made this twice and one of those times, I tried to rush the process and mixed all the tofu in at once, and end up with a LOT of extra starch just kind of hanging out and clumping in the sauce.

While I like broccoli, I don\u2019t prepare it often. I used potato starch instead of corn starch and baked it in the toaster oven at 425 for 20 minutes and finished it off on broil so they were browned. Liked the fact that they were nice and chewy and yummy. Will definitely use the batter for other veggies, and the sauce for other dishes.

I do think it gets soft enough just frying, so it is up to you. I am not sure how well the coating would work on steamed broccoli. However, you could give it a try., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Car, , , January 5, 2020 at 8:29 pm, , , , You might try leaving your broccoli uncovered in the refrigerator a couple of days.

If you only have sugar, that may work, but it may be a little grainy. I don\u2019t normally add regular sugar to a sauce that won\u2019t be cooked.

This dish is the perfect (vegan) appetizer for any party!, PS I\u2019ve think the bright red flecks I mentioned in my previous comment, come from chili sauce.

Will these be ok if I keep them in a crockpot in the sauce to stay warm?, , , , , , , , , , , , Jeeca, , , December 10, 2023, , Reply, , , , , , , Hi Sue! These should be good to keep them warm, but do note that they can become very soggy and break apart faster since there\u2019s that extra moisture from the steam that\u2019ll be trapped in the pot. Another good option would be to keep the sauce in the crockpot and keep the balls in a separate container \u2013 then your guests can just pour the sauce depending on the number number of tofu balls they get. Hope this helps!  \u25e1\u0308, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Marjan, , , , March 5, 2024, , Reply, , , , , , , The best vegan dish I\u2019ve made so far \ud83d\ude0b thank you for the recipe!, , , , , , , , , , , , Jeeca, , , March 5, 2024, , Reply, , , , , , , Thank you Marjan!

Yes these store really well!
