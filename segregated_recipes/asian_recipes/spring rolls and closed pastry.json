They also go best with a spicy sauce and should be eaten hot., , , , What to serve with Momos, , We love steaming hot veg momos with a spicy sauce. I make these on days when we crave for some southeast asian food., , I have had one of the best dim sum in the Mainland China Restaurant decades back. That time I did not know that dim sum would become a popular street food in the northern parts of India., , Some years back when we lived in Gurgaon, I was amazed to see dim sum as a street food snack in many places., , When living in Goa, there was a restaurant just a few kilometers from our place and specialized only in momos with different kinds of stuffings. The owner\u2019s wife was a Tibetan and she and her staff would prepare the dumplings, , The sauce they used to serve with the momos was a spicy, hot sauce and so good. I even had these steamed dumplings with a very spicy sauce in Dharamsala, India., , The veg momos are not spicy but the sauce that is served with these is spicy. I have a really good recipe of a spicy momos sauce which we call as, Momos Chutney, . You can try this spicy momo sauce when you make these steamed dumplings., , You can even serve these with, Schezwan Sauce, or sriracha sauce or hoisin sauce or red chilli garlic sauce., , Expert Tips, , Dough:, The dough has to be firm and tight. Do not add more water and make the dough soft. A softer dough won\u2019t be easy to shape., , Stuffing:, For the stuffing you could use your favorite veggies. You could also make a stuffing with just button mushrooms or a mix of fresh mushrooms. Another variation would be use some mashed or boiled potatoes and paneer (Indian cottage cheese., , Spices, herbs and seasonings:, In the stuffing I prefer some umami and so I love adding soy sauce. But you can experiment with different flavors here. Say \u2013 Indian ground spices and herbs, Mexican seasoning, Miso or any flavor profile you like., , Steaming:, While steaming do keep some space between the dumplings. After steaming the momos expand and you don\u2019t want them sticking to each other. The steaming can be done in an Instant Pot, Electric Cooker, Pot or even in a Idli steamer (all options mentioned in the notes section of the recipe card below)., , Checking for doneness:, After the momos are steamed, when you touch the dough it should not feel sticky. The momos will also look transparent., , Gluten Free:, You can make dim sum gluten-free by using a millet flour or rice flour. Just shaping them can be tricky. Add enough boiling water, \u00bd teaspoon oil, \u00bc teaspoon salt to 1 cup of any millet flour or rice flour. Mix with a spoon. Cover and let dough become warm and then knead to a smooth dough., , More Awesome Indian Street Food, Snacks Recipes, Samosa Recipe (With Potato & Green Peas), Indian Street Food Recipes, Pani Puri, Indian Street Food Recipes, Pav Bhaji Recipe (Stovetop & Instant Pot), Indian Street Food Recipes, Sev Puri (Indian Chaat Snack), , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

        "Vegan Pork Bao": "Ingredients: Step 3: Assemble the vegan \u2018pork\u2019 buns, When ready, transfer the dough onto a work surface, and knead it again to remove the air bubbles. Divide into 14 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Here, I like to knead again to ensure the tiny bubbles are popped., Take a ball, flatten it with your palm. Using a rolling pin, roll it into a 4-inch diameter circle., Top with a heaping spoon of filling, then wrap to seal the dumpling. Continue with the remaining dough. Be sure to cover the wrapped dough with a towel to prevent them from drying out., Step 4: Cook and serve, Now, take a 10-inch non-stick skillet and add a tablespoon of oil. Swirl the pan so the oil covers the bottom of the pan. Place the 14 small dumplings in the pan in one single layer with a slight gap. These tiny gaps will help push the buns up when cooked., Set the skillet on the stove and turn heat to medium-high. After about 1-2 minutes, add 1/2 cup of water into the pan and it should sizzle, so be extra careful. You can also take a peek to see if you have successfully browned the bun\u2019s bottom before adding the liquid., Cover with lid. If you have a tight lid, use a fork to create a gap in between the cover and pan. Cook the buns over medium heat until they fluff up and the water has evaporated. You should hear less and less sizzle when the buns are almost done., Turn off the heat, uncover and garnish with chopped scallions and toasted sesame seeds. Serve them warm with a side of chile oil in soy sauce for a delicious meal., Vegan Pork Jian Bao Cooking Tips, The filling seasoning \u2013 I used dark soy sauce, soy sauce, and vegan \u2018oyster\u2019 sauce (Vegetarian Stir-fry sauce) from Lee Kum Kee.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or until ready to use., Transfer proofed dough onto a floured surface, roll it into a log and divide into 14 equal portions. Then, roll each dough into a ball and set aside, covered. Knead it a few times to remove air bubbles, then divide it into 14 equal portions. Roll each dough into a ball by pulling the edge and tuck under the dough. This step will further remove additional air bubbles if there are any., Before assembling the buns, Cook and serve, To cook the buns, add a tablespoon of oil in a 10-inch non-stick skillet. Fit the 14 buns in the skillet, slightly apart. Set the skillet on the stove over medium heat. Cook for 1-2 minutes then add in the water from the side of the skillet to avoid touching the buns. It should start to sizzle as soon as the water goes in. Alternatively, check the bottom of the bun to make sure they are slightly golden before adding the water., Cover the pan with a lid and cook until the buns fluff up and water has evaporated. Place a fork in between the lid and pan during cooking if you have a tight lid., Garnish with chopped scallions and toasted sesame seeds then serve warm with a side of chile oil in soy sauce., Video, Notes, Reply, , woonheng, February 7, 2022 at 5:46 pm, Hi M Lin, thanks so much for your feedback. I\u2019m glad the filling turned out great for you despite the dough\u2019s not working well. In the recipe section, there is a metric and us customary button that you can switch easily for weight. I bought this paid feature for all my non-US viewers because I love the weight measurement in certain recipes as well. I do wish the \u2018see notes\u2019 next to [240 g all-purpose flour or plain flour] can be in different color so it stands out more that can immediately direct you to the Note section. Thanks again for this feedback and in the future, I\u2019ll highlight the notes clearer in the How to section as well. Have a wonderful day., Reply, , Rebecca, November 20, 2021 at 1:12 pm, I love buns! Whenever I make them though they always end up too thin on top and too thick on the bottom. Any tips to prevent this?, Reply, , woonheng, November 20, 2021 at 3:56 pm, Hi Rebecca, thanks for sharing your feedback. When you roll out the dough, aim to create a thinner circumference, so your middle part is thicker, which looks like a sunflower. This way when you close the edges you\u2019ll have a puffed top and bottom which makes the bun fluffy and even on both sides. Hope that helps. Thanks!., Reply, , Yury Chu, October 16, 2021 at 6:17 pm, How can i store these buns?, Reply, , Marc, October 9, 2021 at 4:45 pm, This looks great. Making them now. Some recipe feedback., 1. use weights for flour. volume will result in too many people getting bad results, 2. suggest an alternate for shaoxing wine. I had it, but tbh, most people won\u2019t, and a good sub it would help people., 3. help people by suggesting how long proofing will take., 4. Omipork probably sponsored this, but suggesting impossible pork would help also. I used the spicy version, and it\u2019s yummy!, Reply, , woonheng, October 9, 2021 at 8:04 pm, Thank you so much, Marc for your awesome feedback. I always recommend others to weigh their flour as it\u2019s more accurate and it\u2019s under my cooking tips. I do have an alternative for shaoxing wine also under cooking tips, but I will include that again on the notes section under recipe card in case readers click \u2018jump to recipe\u2019. Yes, Omnipork sponsored this as mentioned in the post, and thanks for your suggestion. I haven\u2019t tried impossible products much (maybe only once) but it\u2019s good to know they have the pork version now. Thanks again and really happy to hear you liked the recipe. Have a wonderful weekend., Reply, , Darlene, October 11, 2021 at 1:36 pm, Hi! This looks delicious and I\u2019m interested in trying it. Could you please clarify on the weight suggestions? I see you provided a link to a different recipe, are you suggesting using that recipe for the dough, or are you saying to use 240g instead of 2 cups and otherwise come back to this page? Personally, I prefer using weight as I\u2019ve been burned by cups with previous attempts at buns & breads, so it would be nice to have it included in this recipe as opposed to linking to a different recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I look forward to trying it!, Reply, , woonheng, October 11, 2021 at 1:49 pm, Hi Darlene, my newer recipe allows you to switch from the customary US to metric measurements. Thanks for your suggestion and I\u2019ve added a quick note to use weighted flour instead. Hope you like it. Thanks, WoonHeng, Reply, , Darlene, October 12, 2021 at 3:13 pm, So it does, thanks for pointing that out! I\u2019ll give it a try this evening, thanks again for sharing your delicious recipes!, , Bethany, October 8, 2021 at 12:01 pm, These were awesome.  I couldn\u2019t get the ground \u201cpork\u201d because my Sprouts only carries the shredded.  Also, mine were not so pretty and were odd-shaped.  The good news, my family loved them and I will make them again., Reply, , woonheng, October 9, 2021 at 8:10 pm, Yay, thanks so much, Bethany! I\u2019m so happy you gave this recipe a try. I hope your store will have the other two soon. They are so good! The odd shape may be from proofing the bun. Let me know if you need anything else and happy to hear your family loved it. Thanks so so much! Have a beautiful weekend.

And if my skillet is smaller than 10 inch, no issue to cook them in 2 batches?, Reply, , Shu-Chun, October 1, 2021 at 8:39 am, This looks interesting, I\u2019m wondering how it actually tastes like?, Reply, , woonheng, October 9, 2021 at 8:37 pm, Hello Shu-Chun, the texture is as versatile as pork. As for the taste, I like it better than pork but it\u2019s probably because I haven\u2019t had meat in a long time. \ud83d\ude42, Reply, Leave a Reply, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , Recipe Rating, , Recipe Rating, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Comment, *, Name, *, , Email, *, , , , Primary Sidebar, Hello and Welcome, friends, , My name is WoonHeng and I share Asian plant-based deliciousness that you can make in your kitchen.
