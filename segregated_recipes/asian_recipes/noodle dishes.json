Indo-Chinese recipes originated from the Kolkata streets but have taken over Indian cuisine since its inception. In the beginning, it was just fried rice and noodles, but has adapted all the variations and extensions of Asian cuisine. One of them is the Chowmein recipe and the adapted version is the vegetarian chowmein recipe, loaded with vegetables and spices., , I am not a huge fan of Indo-Chinese cuisine and I like Indian-style curries and rice variations. Yet I have a special interest in noodles, perhaps due to the Maggi noodles introduced to me during my school days. I generally end up making simple Maggi noodles with vegetables topping in them. But I do get the craving for Asian-style noodles too. Especially the crunchy yet cooked vegetables in it due to the high-intensity flame cooking. In addition, the sauce used would nicely coat the individual noodles making it a perfect lunch or dinner meal. In addition to the Asian sauces, I have added a hint of Indian spices mixed with Asian sauce. Thus making it an ideal Indo-Chinese recipe, meeting the native taste buds., , , , , , , Furthermore, some additional tips suggestions, and variations to the, Veg Chowmein recipe, . Firstly, vegetable chopping or cutting is very critical for this recipe. It has to be sliced lengthwise but thinly so that it can be tossed at high flame and gets cooked easily. Moreover, you can also add any choice of vegetables as per your preference. Secondly, I would heavily recommend using dry noodles and boiling them to cook. Avoid using the ready-to-, use, noodles as they may break and turn mushy when tossed. Lastly, if you do not like to add all the Indian spices one by one, you can stick to just one garam masala. this should have been slightly more effective than the other spices added, but it should be alright., , finally some more additional, Indo-Chinese Recipes Collection, with this post of, veg chowmein recipe, . it includes my other related recipe collections like, spring rolls, , , Manchurian fried rice, , , veg fried rice, , , masala noodles, , , hakka noodles, , , Manchurian gravy, , , paneer fried rice, , , veg noodles, , , Schezwan noodles, , , sweet corn soup, . further to these i would also like to mention my other recipe categories like,, , , Chaat Recipes, , Snacks Recipes, , Bakery Recipes, , , , , Must Read:, , , , , , , , , , , , sweets recipes, Gulab Jamun Recipe \u2013 Soft with..., , , , , , , , , , , , , paneer recipes, Matar Paneer Pulao Recipe | Kaju..., , , , , , , , , , , , , starters or entree, Cheesy Garlic Bread Recipe \u2013 Dominos..., , , , , , , , , , 00:02:12, , , , dal recipes, Dal Makhani Recipe Restaurant Style in..., , , , , , , , , , , , , curry recipes, Matar Paneer Recipe | Dhaba Style..., , , , , , , , , , , , , paneer recipes, Dahi Ke Kabab Recipe | Hung..., , , , , About Veg Chowmein, , It is a popular Indian street food recipe prepared with medium-sized noodles, thinly sliced vegetables, Asian sauces, and Indian spices. In short, , Veg Chowmein, or, Vegetable Chowmein, is a fusion of Indian and Asian cuisine recipes to match the local or native Indian taste buds. It is typically served as an appetizer, or starter but can also be served as a main course. Typically it goes best with Manchurian sauce or with any types of Asian soups and sauces., , There are many different types of Chowmein recipes across India and the variations mainly depend upon the hero ingredient added to it. The most common is, Veg Chowmein, , which is loaded with all types of vegetables. However, adding different types of meat to it, makes it a more balanced and complete meal. Even the meat variant can take any type of vegetable in it.

        "Veggie Lo Mein": "Ingredients: , , , , , , , , 2, , , , Chop Your Veggies and Cook Your Noodles, , My favorite veggies for Lo Mein are mushrooms, carrots, bell peppers, and bok choy, but you can really use just about any veggie you\u2019d like. Broccoli and cabbage are good ones, too!, , , , , , , , , 3, , , , Toss It All Together, , Your noodles are cooked, your veggies are chopped, and your sauce is ready to go. Now, you just need to saut\u00e9 it all together in a hot wok or skillet and you\u2019ve got easy, delicious Lo Mein \u2013 at home!, , , , , , , Lo Mein: Frequently Asked Questions, , What kind of noodles do you recommend?, , These ones, here, , (affiliate link), are perfect!, , , Are lo mein noodles gluten-free?, , Traditional lo mein noodles are made with wheat, so they are not gluten free. Feel free to sub in rice noodles or your favorite GF spaghetti noodles to make this gluten-free!, , , Why did you use two different types of soy sauce?, , It adds more depth and flavor to the dish \u2013 especially the, dark soy sauce, , (affiliate link), . Highly recommend using both if you can find them. If not, , regular soy sauce, , (affiliate link), can always work., , , What is mirin?, , Mirin is a type of rice wine. It adds a sweeter flavor, which is a really wonderful contrast to the saltiness from the soy sauce here., , , How could I add chicken or beef to this recipe?, , It would be super easy to add meat to this! Thinly slice your chicken or beef, toss it in a little bit of the lo mein sauce (just enough to coat it), then brown/sear it in the pan before adding your veggies, noodles, and sauce., , , How is lo mein different from chow mein?, , The main difference between the two is in how the noodles are cooked \u2013 chow mein noodles are fried, and lo mein noodles are cooked and tossed. I\u2019d recommend, this recipe, from Recipe Tin Eats if you\u2019re looking for Chow Mein!, , , , , What Goes In Lo Mein Sauce, , You need a good soy sauce, and I HIGHLY recommend the 2-types-of-soy-sauce trick. It\u2019s not really a trick as much as it is a tiny thing that makes a big difference. It\u2019s probably more likely that you have\u00a0light or low sodium soy sauce in your fridge, but tip alert: dark soy sauce is so rich in umami flavor and it takes this Lo Mein \u201csauce\u201d situation to a whole new level., , Because the quality of soy sauce is important here (I mean, I did not use soy sauce packets from leftover takeout., , I used this, light\u00a0soy sauce, //, dark\u00a0soy sauce, combo, (affiliate links)., , Shake that up in a jar with a quick hit of sesame oil and a pinch of sugar. annnnd DONE., , How To Make This A Chicken (Or Beef) Lo Mein, , I love this recipe as a base for vegetable lo mein, but it would be easy enough to add some protein like chicken or beef (or maybe even shrimp!?)., , Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:, , , Thinly slice your chicken or beef., , Toss it in a little bit of the lo mein sauce (just enough to coat it) and let it sit for a bit., , Brown/sear it in the pan before adding your veggies, noodles, and sauce., , , And that\u2019s it!, , What Noodles To Use For Lo Mein, , You could use fresh Lo Mein noodles if you can find it fresh or frozen at your grocery store. I could not find it at any of my regular places, so in its place I have used\u00a0either dry ramen if you can find it (as long as you\u2019re hitting up Amazon for the soy sauce, grab a box of, this ramen, , too \u2013, affiliate link, ) and/or just regular spaghetti., , \u2026Is that blasphemy to Lo Mein? to use spaghetti?, , I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m thinking we both\u00a0care more about practicality than total and complete authenticity., , Go on and do what you need to do., , If you\u2019re gluten-free, you can use rice noodles or your favorite gluten-free spaghetti noodle., , And in a quick flash of the pan, with the sauce and the noodles and the veggies all partying it up in there, we\u2019ve reached the tippy top\u00a0of the Lo Mein journey.\u00a0The part where you\u00a0wind those silky noodles up on a fork with a few pieces of caramelized pan-fried veggies and treat yourself right., , Easy Homemade Lo Mein, comin in hot!, , , , I Hope You Love This Easy Lo Mein!, , Until two weeks ago, and plus, did you know that you can get a platter of Lo Mein large enough to feed the\u00a0neighborhood\u00a0for just $6.50 at the Panda Buffet? So why would we even do this at home? I\u2019m serious \u2013 let\u2019s go., , Except hold the phone for just a sec., , , Making Lo Mein is, not, a lengthy process \u2013 it\u2019s going to come together in ONE PAN in\u00a0something like 15 minutes, start to finish. JOY of JOYS. I seriously had no idea when I set out to learn about all things Lo Mein that it would be such a\u00a0gem\u00a0of a quick + easy recipe, and not in the way where you\u2019re skimping on anything. Just by nature, it is that simple., , at all. A\u00a0quality\u00a0soy sauce and sesame oil combo is basically it. That\u2019s\u00a0your\u00a0Lo Mein magic right there. For real \u2013 just one bottle of good soy sauce and you\u2019re\u00a0in Lo Mein business. I mean, almost everyone, no matter what their cooking level is, has a bottle of soy sauce in their fridge, right? or at the very least, a few PACKETS of soy sauce from leftover takeout? You know I see you out there., , And finally, Lo Mein is awesome as takeout, but it\u2019s more awesome\u00a0as a\u00a0mostly-healthy takeout at home dish that can simultaneously clean out the fridge by using up any and all veggies and proteins that a person could ever want in their silky stir-fried noodles.

        "Vegan Pho": "Ingredients: perfectly cooked rice sticks, sauteed tofu and all the toppings in the world! Comfort food at its best!, , I am kind of rekindling my love for Asian fare these days. I find myself cooking delicious, comforting, spicy and yummy Asian recipes over and over., , , This vegan pho is our all time favorite and make it very frequently at home. The recipe is super easy, as easy as boiling water., , Yes, once you have the toppings prepped, this Vietnamese noodles soup gets ready in no time. Not only delicious, this is a quirky fun dish to assemble and serve., , Whenever I want a comforting broth on a cold day, I resort to either bowl of piping hot, rasam rice, or, pasta soup, or this yummy vegan pho., , Whether you have tasted this before or hearing it for the first time, I highly recommend you to try this recipe at home. You will be surely pleased., , What Is Pho?, , Pho is Vietnamese noodle soup with a deep flavorful broth and rice noodles. Traditional pho is made with beef broth. The main attraction of this noodle soup is the array of toppings in varied textures and colors., , For making a vegan version of homemade pho we are using a vegetable broth which is further flavored with whole spices, onion, cabbage and carrots. If you eat mushrooms you can add it in broth for deep earthy flavor., , This is my take on authentic pho from Vietnamese restaurants based on the vegetarian version I have tasted from a tiny Asian takeaway., , , We like to load up this vegan pho with as many toppings as possible., , Always serve pho piping hot. Keep the broth, noodles and toppings separately and assemble just before serving. For a more fun meal you can have build your own noodle bowl party!, , This Vegan Pho Is, , , So flavorful, tasty and hearty, , easy and quick to make, , served with variety of toppings, , Gluten free recipe., , , Making this classic noodle soup can be broken into three steps, , , preparing the broth, , preparing the toppings & noodles, , Assemble and serve., , , Here I have broken down the recipe in three steps for easy understanding. Before going into the recipe, , , For broth, , , Stock, \u2013 Any good quality homemade or store bought veggie stock. If you don\u2019t have time to make stock just use water., , Whole spices, \u2013 This pho broth made without meat gets all its flavor from whole spices and veggies. We need star anise, green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon bark and coriander seeds. These whole spices infused in stock produces a very flavorful broth., , Veggies, \u2013 Onion, carrot, ginger and some cabbage simmered in stock to deepen the flavor of broth., , Soy sauce or tamari, \u2013 A splash of sauce adds a wonderful flavor. I have used tamari here. If you want to make gluten free pho make sure to use tamari., , Sweetener, \u2013 Traditionally pho broth is sweetened with yellow rock sugar. Since I don\u2019t have it, I used light brown sugar., , , , , , Rice noodles or rice sticks, \u2013 I used my flat rice noodles that I usually use for pad thai. These are very delicate and don\u2019t require much of cooking. Most of them just need to be soaked in warm water until soft. Make sure to add few drops of oil to the cooked noodles to prevent them from sticking to each other., , Tofu-, To add some protein and substance to this vegan pho, I usually add some toasted tofu cubes. If you are making vegetarian pho you can also add paneer or halloumi cubes., , , Toppings For Vegetarian Pho, , , Veggies, \u2013 I love to load up this noodle soup bowl with as many veggies as possible. Here I have added cabbage, peppers, onions. While you can add raw veggies, I prefer to very lightly saute the cabbage and peppers., , Sprouts, \u2013 Crunchy bean sprouts add so much texture and taste to this soup. I have used homemade green mung sprouts.You can use any variety of sprouts you like., , Fresh herbs- cilantro leaves, mint and basil leaves., , Veggies- You can add raw veggies like bok choy, cabbage leaves or add sauteed veggies like I did here., , , How To Make Vegan Pho, , Pho Broth, , Heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a pan. Add halved onion and ginger piece. Cook in high heat for 3-4 minutes or until the onion and ginger char well., , , Now add 3 cups stock, whole spices, shredded or cubed veggies., , , Next add tamari, chili paste or any hot sauce like siracha, brown sugar and salt to taste. Bring to a boil., , , Cover and simmer for 5-6 minutes., , , Strain and set aside the pho broth until use., , Preparing the veggies & noodles, , Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a skillet. Add shredded cabbage and saute for 2 minutes., , , Add tofu cubes to the same oil and toast until crispy., , , Cube the peppers, carrots and saute for a minute if preferred., , perfectly cooked rice sticks, sauteed tofu and all the toppings in the world!

My whole family was making Mmmm sounds while eating! :)  The tahini, peanut butter, garlic, vinegar, oil mix is just so fantastic tasting!!!  I altered it slightly to what I had on hand.  I used red wine vinegar in place of the sherry wine vinegar, vegetarian chicken stock in place of the sherry, I omitted the chili oil, and used a green bell pepper instead of yellow.  Thanks Sharon for another delicious recipe!

I nearly skipped the tahini - I've never had it in a noodle dish like this - but it was actually good!  It balances out the peanut butter.  I used linguini instead of spaghetti.  I also \"passed\" on the sherry and used the balsamic option for the sherry vinegar. It was a great late night adventure!  I'll make it again at a more reasonable hour...., , , , , , , , , , justcallmejulie, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , RECIPE SUBMITTED BY, , , , , , , , , , , , Sharon123, , , , , Murphy, 73, , , , , , , icons / following, , Follow Me, , , , , , , , , 396, Followers, , , , , 3308, Recipes, , , , , 232, Tweaks, , , , , , , , <p><br /><br />I live in the mountains of N.C. and love it here.
