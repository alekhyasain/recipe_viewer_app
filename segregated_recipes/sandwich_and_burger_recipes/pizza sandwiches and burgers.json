pizza burger assembling:, , , , , 8, , notes:, , , , , , pizza burger recipe | burger pizza in kadai | pizza cheeseburger, with step by step photo and video recipe. burger and pizza recipes have always been one of the popular choices of young age groups. however, these recipes have to be innovative so that it does not become monotonous with its audience group. hence it has to lead to fusion recipes and one of the popular fusion recipe introduced by fast food joints is pizza burger recipe., , as i was explaining earlier, the recipe was introduced by dominos, but there has been a lot of variations to the original recipe. when it was introduced, it was made with burger buns stuffed with pizza sauce and cheese stuffed between 2 burger slices. in addition, the burger buns are freshly made and the stuffing is stuffed inside the dough before the baking. however, this can be complicated if you are attempting at home. hence i have improvised the recipe by using the store-bought burger buns. moreover, i have used the pizza sauce made for the pizza pockets from macdonalds. basically, the pizza sauce is not just sauce and contains finely chopped and diced veggies in it. i felt this combination would be ideal for my variation of, pizza cheeseburger, ., , , furthermore, i would like to add more tips, suggestions and variations to burger pizza recipe in kadai. firstly, i have prepared the pizza sauce recipe from scratch by adding veggies to it. you can use store-bought pizza sauce, but it may not contain veggies in it. hence you may have to separately steam the veggies before using in this recipe. secondly, i have topped the burger with pizza sauce and cheese to have the pizza flavour in each bite. you may skip it, as the traditional burger pizza does not have this additional step. lastly, i would heavily recommend using, mozzarella, cheese for this recipe. however, you may also use cheddar cheese, especially for the topping on a top burger bun., , finally, i request you to check my other related, sandwich recipes collection, with this post of, pizza burger recipe, . it includes my other related recipes like, grilled cheese pizza sandwich \u2013 in kadai,
