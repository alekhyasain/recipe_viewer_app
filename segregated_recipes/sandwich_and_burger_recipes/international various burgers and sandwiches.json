        "Italian Eggplant Sandwich": "Ingredients: , Now add your fried eggplant to the bottom bun and top it with your jalapenos, mushrooms, and another generous helping of sauce and your favourite vegan mozzarella cheese. Add the top bun and consider cutting your freshly created Italian Eggplant Sandwich in half. It is a hearty sandwich and can tend to get a bit messy if you try and eat it without cutting it in half., , For all of you out there considering going vegan take us up on our, 30 Day Vegan Challenge, and try it for 30 days. James has taken up the torch and is going vegan for 30 days as well so you won\u2019t be doing it alone. Why not bring your friends along too? There are also many tasty recipes already on this blog to aid you in your quest, and many more to come., , Buon appetito!!!, , , , , , , 4.7, from, 3, reviews, , , , Italian Eggplant Sandwich: Vegan Recipe, , , , , , , Save, , Print, , , , , , Prep time, , , 15 mins, , , , , Cook time, , , 30 mins, , , , , Total time, , , 45 mins, , , , , , , A mouth watering sandwich recipe that's a twist on the classic Italian Veal Sandwich, substituting eggplant for veal turning it into a true vegan delight that many would also say is an even better tasting Italian sandwich than the original., , , Author:, The Edgy Veg, , Recipe type:, Dinner, , Cuisine:, Italian, , Serves:, 4, , , , , , 4 crusty Kaiser buns, , Homemade Marinara Sauce, , 1 medium eggplant, peeled and cut into \u00bc-inch-thick rounds, , 2 cups seasoned bread crumbs, , 3 eggs worth of, egg replacer, , 4 Jalape\u00f1o peppers, thinly sliced, , 4 cups Mushrooms, sliced, , 1 cup of, olive oil, , 4 slices, vegan mozzarella cheese, , Salt, to taste, , , , ,  Instructions: , To make the \u201cmeaty\u201d part of this epic Italian sandwich you will start by dipping your eggplant slice into an egg replacement being sure to coat it evenly. The thickness of the slice and your choice of egg replacement is simply a matter of personal preference, but I wouldn\u2019t go too much thicker than \u00bd inch rounds. Once you have your Eggplant thoroughly coated place it in a bowl of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and make sure you coat it evenly in those as well. After those two steps are complete put your breaded eggplant into a pan of hot oil and fry it until it reaches a nice crispy light-brown consistency., , , , Prepare the marinara sauce, and heat through. Once heated, reduce heat to keep warm., , Add 3 tbsp of olive oil to a large-size pan, and heat over medium high heat. Add mushrooms with a sprinkle of salt and cook stirring occasionally, until the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms are tender and browned. This should take about 10 minutes. Lower heat to keep warm., , Add 2 tbsp of olive oil to a medium-size pan, and heat over medium high heat. Add jalape\u00f1os with a sprinkle of salt and cook stirring occasionally, until the liquid evaporates and the jalape\u00f1os are soft and bright green. This should take about 5-8 minutes. Lower heat to keep warm., , In a medium-size, shallow bowl, whisk together your egg replacer. In a second bowl, add the seasoned breadcrumbs. Add \u00be cup olive oil to a skillet and heat over medium-high heat until oil is heated to 325F, or until it bubbles when you add a couple bread crumbs., That is how I always test my oil., , Working in batches, dip the eggplant into the egg replacer, and then coat completely in breadcrumbs. Place the eggplant medallions in oil and fry until lightly golden and cooked through on both sides, about 4 minutes per batch. When eggplant is completely cooked, remove from frying pan and place onto paper towels to blot any excess oil., , Place your buns in the oven at 400F for 2 minutes or place facedown on a pan to toast slightly. Remove buns form heat and spoon about 2 tbsp worth of marinara sauce on both halves and top with vegan mozzarella cheese. Place 2 or 3 eggplant slices onto warmed crusty bun and top with mushrooms and jalape\u00f1os. if you like a really saucy sandwich you can also add more sauce. Top with second half of the bun, cut in half and enjoy!, , , , , , Notes, , The spices I use to season breadcrumbs are: Dried parsley, basil, oregano, a pinch of salt and cracked black pepper., , , , 3.5.3226, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Search for:, , , , , , , , , , , , , Newest Recipes, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Mar 18, th, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Shallots Confit Recipe, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Mar 11, th, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Vegan Chocolate Marshmallow Cookies Recipe, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Feb 14, th, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Vegan Strawberry Chocolate Recipe, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , On sale now, , , , Easy Eats, Cookbook, , , , Buy Now, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Share, , , , , fb, , , , , , , , , , , tw, , , , , , , , , , , li, , , , , , , , , , , pn, , , , , , , , , , , tmb, , , , , , , , , , , vk, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Leave a comment, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , Recipe Rating, , , , Recipe Rating, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Post as a question, , , Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment., , Sign me up for more Edgy Veg!, Submit Comment, , , , , Rate this recipe:, , , , , , \u0394, , , , , All Comments, , Questions, , , , , , , , , , , Ann, says:, , , on, September 8, 2017, , , , , , Reply, , , , I used unbreaded, sauteed chopped eggplant mixed in with the marinara.
