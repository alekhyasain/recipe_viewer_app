        "Vegan Philly CheeseSteak": "Ingredients: , Then, start by cleaning the mushrooms with a damp cloth, and then cutting them into slices that are roughly a centimeter thick., , and whisk them together briefly. Pour this mixture over the mushrooms, and then allow them to marinate for a minimum of thirty minutes, though overnight would be best., , , Next, slice the bell peppers and the onions, and then stir fry them before wiping the pan out with some kitchen paper. In that same pan, fry the marinated mushrooms with all of the marinades until they\u2019re brown and crispy - this should take five to ten minutes. Don\u2019t rush this process, your patience will pay off with some beautifully crispy mushrooms., , Next, followed by the oil and soy milk. Stir the mixture well until it is properly combined and lump-free. Bring that mixture to a boil on medium-low heat, and then allow it to thicken for two to three minutes whilst stirring., , Then, cut the bread, and toast it gently on a hot pan or grill. The goal is to give the bread texture without creating a solid surface - allowing a small amount of the juices from your sandwich into the bread will be a taste sensation!, , Finally, assemble the vegan Philly \u2018cheesesteak\u2019 - place the cooked mushrooms on the bottom of the sandwich, followed by some of the saut\u00e9ed veggies. Finally, finish the sandwich with the vegan cheese sauce - we won\u2019t tell anyone if you deliberately put a bit too much on\u2026, , , If you\u2019d like, you could coat the bread with a thin layer of vegan mayo, or vegan butter. Both of these would do a great job of moistening the bread, but the sandwich doesn\u2019t need it, truthfully., , Once you\u2019ve assembled and plated the sandwich, enjoy it with fries, pickled cabbage or onions, and a side salad. In true American deli fashion, it\u2019s worth truly going for it with the sides.
