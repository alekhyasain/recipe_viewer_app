        "Hummus Avocado Sandwich": "Ingredients: use whatever vegetables you do have on hand. It\u2019s a no-brainer, easy lunch option!, , This vegetable sandwich happens to be vegan, rivaling my, Edamame Hummus Veggie Wrap, for a delicious plant-based lunch. If you\u2019re looking for something with less carbs and still meatless, try my, Curry Egg Salad Collard Green Wraps, ., , , , Tips for making this avocado sandwich:, , For the bread, I use a thin-slice version, such as, the one, (affiliate link) from Dave\u2019s Bread. I prefer less bulk in my bread, allowing the flavor of the veggies to shine. Plus\u2026less calories., , Lightly toast the bread. Just enough to provide a little crunch, but not so toasty that the bread crumbles when you bite into it., , Mash the avocado with a dash of kosher salt. Add pepper if you\u2019d like, or spice things up with cayenne pepper or ground cumin., , Pile on the veggies! I used cucumber and tomato slices, and broccoli sprouts, but feel to swap in your favorites (see below for substitution suggestions)., , If cheese is a \u201cmust\u201d for you and you aren\u2019t aiming for a vegan sandwich, try a slice of sharp cheddar or smoky Gouda, or some crumbled goat cheese or feta., , , What are broccoli sprouts?, , Broccoli sprouts look very similar to alfalfa sprouts and can be found in the produce section of many supermarkets. Alternatively, they can easily be grown at home in a mason jar. Hop onto YouTube for plenty of tutorials for growing them!, , Broccoli sprouts are germinated broccoli seeds. While fully mature broccoli boasts plenty of health benefits, broccoli seeds are even more beneficial, thanks to a compound called sulforaphane which has been shown to aid in preventing DNA damage that can lead to cancer (e.g., see, this study, )., , Packed broccoli sprouts in sandwiches and salads, or blend them into green smoothies or smoothie bowls., , Ingredient substitution suggestions:, , I always have tomatoes, cucumber, broccoli sprouts on hand, so that\u2019s what I used. But feel free to swap in your favorites., , Go for a Mediterranean vibe with cucumber and tomatoes drizzled with a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar, sliced canned artichokes, kalamata olives and feta cheese., , Give the sandwich some southwestern flair by using smashed black beans instead of hummus. Add roasted corn and mix the avocado with some pico de gallo. If using cheese, Pepper Jack or a few crumbles of queso fresco work well., , , Other healthy sandwich recipes:, , Edamame Hummus Veggie Wrap, {Cookin\u2019 Canuck}, , Turkey Panini with Apple, Cheddar & Arugula, {Cookin\u2019 Canuck}, , BBQ Tempeh Sandwich, {Sweet Potato Soul}, , Loaded Tex-Mex Wrap, {Fit Men Cook}, , Printable Recipe, , , , Vegan Hummus Avocado Sandwich, , , This is the veggie hummus avocado sandwich that I make day after day!

You can omit the salt and seek out a low-sodium mayo. Or use our, Vegan Mayo, omitting the salt. Also, instead of canned beans, use fresh cooked chickpeas.

Some avocado, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mustard in a deliciously soft bun for the win., , Adding some vegan cheese or maybe some, vegan mayo, would also be awesome here., , Have them for lunch or dinner, with a side salad or, fries, , or just on their own., , Gluten-Free, , If you\u2019re gluten-free, then switch out the flour for a gluten-free all purpose flour and serve them on gluten-free buns or between two gigantic lettuce leaves., , , Storing and Freezing, , Keep leftover chickpea burgers stored in the fridge for 3-4 days. They can be reheated in the frying pan or in the oven at 350\u00b0F until heated through., , You can freeze the burgers before or after cooking.

I changed a few things in this recipe mostly out of laziness\u2026 I only seasoned with nutritional yeast and salt/pepper because the spice cabinet seemed way too daunting but the flavor was still very good. But most of all I loved how the aquafaba bound the recipes like an egg- I used about half the can of liquid. I also baked mine on parchment (again out of laziness) and they held up better than any other veggie burger/patty, especially when corn is involved they seem to always fall apart but these didn\u2019t! I baked them 40 mins (flipping in between) and they are crispy and well cooked and I\u2019m so excited. I\u2019m going to use aquafaba in all my veggie burgers from now on.

I did safe the rest just in case I\u2019d need to add it.  2) this was my first experience with this kind of pepper and I thought I was going to die from the teeny tiny speck of it I tried before adding a whole one in. So, I only used about 1/3 of that rascal and it turned out just right. 3) I like to bread things using crushed up Ritz crackers so I did that here, too.

kabuli chana. Another unique aspect of this cutlet is that it uses a combination of oats and bread slices as a binding agent. Fresh coriander combined with a bouquet of dried herbs along with lemon juice energises the refreshing green mayonnaise spread. Top it with scrumptious veggies like lettuce, cucumber, onions and tomatoes and serve with spicy potato wedges, for a filling and delicious meal., , , , , , , Tags, , , , , Starters / Snacks, , Indian Veggie Burgers Collection, , American, , American Burgers / American \u00a0Grilled, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Preparation Time, , 15 Mins, , , , , , , Cooking Time, , 15 Mins, , , , , , , Total Time, , 30 Mins, , , , , , , Makes, , 4 burgers, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , For the cutlets, Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and add the onions and sweet corn and saut\u00e9 on a medium flame for 1 minute., Add the kabuli chana, bread, besan, oats, chilli powder, salt and pepper, mix well and saut\u00e9 on a medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes.
