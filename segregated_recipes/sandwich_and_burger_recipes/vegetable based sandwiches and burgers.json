Most store bought mayos are a hit or miss. So choose one carefully. The taste of your sandwich depends on the mayo you choose. If you are a vegetarian then you can choose eggless mayo. If you are a vegan use vegan mayonnaise made with nuts., , However if you do not have any kind of mayo then simply strain your homemade yogurt in a cheese cloth or muslin cloth and use it in the recipe. For more details you may check this recipe of, Hung curd, . The other substitutes for mayo are cream cheese & Greek yogurt., , You can also check these, Cream cheese sandwiches, and, Yogurt sandwich, which are a variation of the recipe shared here., , Bread:, In eateries and cafes mayonnaise sandwich is mostly made with white soft bread. Since we don\u2019t eat white bread I have used multi grain bread. Sometimes I also make these with sourdough bread or artisan bread. So use any kind of bread that is available to you., , Veggies:, The quickest way to make this sandwich by using chopped onions, grated carrots, deseeded chopped firm tomatoes and any fresh herbs like coriander leaves etc. Preparing these will take just 5 to 7 minutes., , Other veggies like bell peppers, sweet corn, beetroot, lettuce, pumpkin, potatoes, arugula (rockets) & cabbage also go well in a mayo sandwich. But they do take some time for preparing like sweet corn, beetroot & potatoes need to be boiled first., , If using broccoli & pumpkin then grill them and use. So choose the veggies of your choice., , I went the simplest way by using onions, lettuce & red bell peppers since I had only these at home., , Spices & herbs:, I use ground black pepper, red chilli flakes and ground mustard (powder). You can use any sauce like mustard sauce, chilli sauce or schezwan sauce for heat., , , , Faqs, , Toasted vs untoasted bread, , This is a personal choice. But these can be made either ways & both taste good. Toasted mayo sandwiches won\u2019t turn soggy quickly. If you are using store bought bread, then with the current situation it is good to toast them., , We prefer the toasted bread to make any sandwich, so I have toasted in a pan. However you can also toast these in a sandwich maker or toast the bread in oven or air fryer., , How to make this in 10 mins., , Firstly toast the buttered bread slices on a pan until golden. While they toast, chop the veggies and make the filling. Once the bread is done, cool them down for 2 to 3 mins and spread the filling. Making 2 servings of these mayo sandwiches just takes 10 mins., , Variations, , Making mayonnaise sandwich with boiled egg and chicken is also common.

If there is egg in it, then it is good to consume within 1 hour of removing it from fridge. You may not smell or taste it bad  but actually it begins to decompose after 1 hour in summers. Have you thought of using hung curd instead of mayo. That really works with little paneer added to it. Keeps fresh for 4 to 5 hours. Hope this helps., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Sunitha, , , , , , March 18, 2018 1:47 am, , , , , , Hi swasti,, Nice recipe\u2026lik to have ur suggestion on buying mayonnaise\u2026.every mayonnaise I store bought tasted sour nd pungent but tat we tasted at restaurants with shawarma ws creamy sweet nd mild\u2026.y such diffence\u2026can u pls guide me to select th ryt mayo lik we taste in restaurnts\u2026, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Sunitha, , , , March 19, 2018 10:41 am, , , , , , Hi Sunitha,, Thanks. Yes most of them are sour tasting. I guess it is the vinegar or citric acid used as a preservative. For shawarma, most places use yogurt garlic sauce made of hung curd. I suggest not to buy mayo if you don\u2019t like the sour flavor. It is anyhow not healthy. Instead make of use hung curd in place of mayo. You can check the, recipe of yogurt sauce used in shawarma here, . You can find it towards the end of the post. You can use the same in burgers, wraps, sandwiches etc. You can also check, this post I have shared another similar sauce, .

, , , , veggie burger recipe | vegetarian burger | veg cheese burger, with step by step photo and video recipe. burger or sandwich recipes have been ultra-popular especially in urban indian cities. even though the burger and sandwich recipes are popularly served as a snack by much fast food vendor, but also gaining popularity for breakfast and lunch. one such simple and healthy burger recipe is the veggie burger recipe made with veggie patties., , as i explained earlier, i have used a minimal approach when it comes to the vegetable toppings. as a matter of fact, i have used only sliced cucumber and tomato slices in terms of vegetable. i was planning to use sliced beetroot slices, lettuce and also boiled potato slices. but at the same time, i wanted to make something like street food. hence i finalised with the above 2 veggies. in addition, i also added pickled, jalapeno, , which is not a mandatory option, but would add the salty, sour taste to it. having said that, i have added all the necessary spices and flavour to the patty and it should be sufficient for this burger. to the patty mixture, i have added chaat masala which should supply the flavours for a street style veg burger., , , furthermore, i would like to conclude with few tips, suggestions and variations for a perfect, veggie burger recipe, . firstly, i have used store-bought burger buns for this recipe and you can use any desired burger bun for it. in addition you can also use pav bread or even sandwich bread slices for this recipe. secondly, the patties are multipurpose and you can use it for roll, paratha and also for chaat recipes. lastly, the shape and thickness of the patties are completely optional and you can shape it to any desired shape or thickness. i personally like thick and meaty patties in my burger, but it is completely optional., , finally, i request you to check my other, sandwich recipes collection, with this post of, veggie burger recipe, . it mainly includes recipes

        "Roasted Tomato Sandwich with vegan lemon garlic aioli": "Ingredients: lemon juice, salt, pepper and garlic are combined in a bowl and chilled until you are ready to eat. This stuff is finger-licking good., , , The tomatoes are also simple to make, (are you seeing the trend with this recipe?), but pack SO much flavor. I love when tomatoes are in season.

So you best believe that tomatoes are going to be making a big appearance over the next few months here on TSV., , I, of course, chose sourdough for this sandwich \u2013 I mean, I can never get enough sourdough. You can use any bread you like, but I would choose something hearty so it can hold up with all of the toppings., , , How to serve Roasted Tomato Sandwiches with Vegan Lemon Garlic Aioli, , To get the sandwich extra toasty, you are going to slather some vegan butter on each slice and grill them in a pan before assembling.

So while making a single or double serving I use the pan or the air fryer for convenience. However for a larger batch or for the family, I use the oven as it gets done faster. This Garlic Cheese Toast goes fantastic with soups, pasta, noodles or even with roast veggies and roast chicken., , This, Tomato Soup, , Sweet, Corn soup, and, Vegetable soup, are some great options. When I make this for dinner, I make this, Red Sauce Pasta, or this, Chicken spaghetti, ., , To make a good Garlic Cheese Toast, you need a good bread. Any kind of medium thickness bread slices work well. Very thick slices won\u2019t melt your cheese if you are making this in a pan. Very thin slices can get too soft after the cheese melts. Avoid using very soft, light and airy bread with large air pockets., , French baguette, sourdough bread (not very crusty), brioche, ciabatta, , , , Butter:, Use unsalted butter for the best flavor. Using salted butter can make your cheese toast too salty since bread and cheese have some salt included in them., , Cheese:, I used mozzarella here. But you can use a combination of mozzarella for a cheesy pull and something for flavor, like Monterey Jack, Colby, Swiss or cheddar. Use block cheese and grate it yourself. Store bought pre-grated are tossed with anticaking agents so they take longer to melt and can turn rubbery., , Garlic:, Fresh minced garlic is very crucial to this garlic cheese toast. Peel and mince fresh. Garlic powder is an alternate but the flavor won\u2019t be the same. Apart from adding fresh garlic to the butter, for additional flavor, I also sprinkle little garlic powder. But the flavors are different with fresh and ground. You may use both if you want., , Herbs:, Parsley, chives, oregano or mixed Italian herbs go well. More importantly use what you like., , Chili flakes and black pepper, can be added for mild heat., , , Garlic Cheese Toast on a Pan, , , Make the garlic butter by mixing together garlic and butter. Butter the bread slices generously on both the sides. Heat a pan on a medium flame and toast the bread until crisp at the bottom., , Turn them to the other side and reduce the heat to low. Spread the cheese, herbs and chili flakes on the hot side of bread (very important). If you want add a generous sprinkle of garlic powder. It is essential to place the cheese on the hot side of the bread else it won\u2019t melt faster., , \u25a2, 6, , slices, , bread, , (any bread of choice), \u25a2, 3 to 4, , tablespoons, , butter, , softened, \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , garlic, , minced or finely chopped, \u25a2, 1 to 1\u00bd, , cup, , cheese, , grated or slices (i use mozzarella), \u25a2, Salt, , (optional), optional, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , parsley, , or cilantro/ coriander leaves, \u25a2, \u00be, , teaspoon, , oregano, , (use more if you want), \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , red chili flakes, , or coarse crushed black pepper,  Instructions: , , , Photo Guide, , , 1.

If you have some dried red chilies, you can pulse them in the mixer and make your own chilli flakes. Skip the oregano and use any herbs you have like fresh coriander leaves or dill leaves., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Deepa, , , , , , September 23, 2018 1:33 pm, , , , , , Dear Swasthi, I tried your cake recipes and pizza, all worked very well.

        "Millet Carrot Cucumber Patty Burger": "Ingredients:  Instructions: , 1. Add\u00a0millet, water and salt in a rice cooker. Cook it at a regular rice setting. When done, let cool a couple minutes in a large bowl., , 2. Add the filling and the seasoning to the slightly cooled millet. Mix well. Add the eggs (one at a time) until they hold well. The texture you\u2019re looking for is similar to mashed potatoes (soft but holds up together well)., , 3. We all know how different our palates are, so test by scoping a sample, frying it and adjust seasoning if necessary., , 4. Once you\u2019re happy with the taste, with slightly wet hands, shape the patties and place them on a large baking sheet. Narrower patties are easier to flip and handle (less likely to break apart). Thinner patties are crispier and thicker patties take longer to cook in the middle (remember there is raw egg in the mix). Make sure it\u2019s even in thickness for even cooking. You could also opt to bake them if you don\u2019t care for crispiness., , 5. Over medium heat, add a thin coat of oil and heat a cast iron or a non stick pan. Add the shaped patties and sear\u00a0for a couple minutes until brown. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan for easier handling of patties., , 6. Gently flip the patties and drizzle some oil. Sear and cook the second side. Be careful as they\u00a0may fall apart. Shake the pan carefully to make sure oil gets to the bottom of the patties. If the patties are thick and if they\u2019re\u00a0browning too fast, turn the heat lower after crisping them\u00a0to allow the insides to cook before the outsides burn. Gently tilt them to sear the edges of the patties as well., , 7. Keep them warm in the oven at 200 F on a wire rack set over a baking sheet while you finish cooking the rest. Serve as is or with tzatziki or aioli., , Notes:, , 1. Alternate filling: \u00a0broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, mushroom, kale\u2026 the sky\u2019s the limit., , 2. Onion and garlic powder can be substitute with 1 small onion and 3 garlic cloves. Finely dice and cook before adding them to the mix., , 3. If you don\u2019t like the strong \u2018raw\u2019 taste of carrots and/or cucumbers, you can add them to the millet to cook., , 4. Decrease the chicken broth to 2 3/4 cups for a coarser (and drier)millet \u00a0and increase to 3 1/4 cups for a finer, softer (and wetter) millet., , 5. When mixing the millet, if you feel like it\u2019s still not binding well, add another egg and adjust the seasoning. If mixture is too wet, add some whole wheat flour or bread crumbs. If mixture is too dry, add some water/broth or eggs., , 6. You can choose to coat both surfaces of millet with ground flaxseed or whole wheat flour to create a extra crispy crust., , 7. I\u2019ve added a couple tablespoons of ground flaxseed into the mix before too and the result is a sticky and chewy texture. Some loved this version, while others didn\u2019t. You can test it out if you want to., , 8. If you have time, don\u2019t add the eggs and let the flavors meld overnight. The next day, let the mixture come to room temperature, add the eggs and proceed to making the millet., , , , , Millet, Patties, , , , , , 1 comment, , , , 0, , , Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, Reddit, Whatsapp, Email, , , , , , , , , AiPing, , Hey you.
