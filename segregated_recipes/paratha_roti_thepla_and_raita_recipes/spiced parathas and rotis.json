        "Chili Garlic Paratha": "Ingredients:  Instructions: ",
        "Ajwain Paratha": "Ingredients: \u25a2, 2 cups (250 grams), , wheat flour, , (atta or substitute with all-purpose flour), \u25a2, 2 teaspoons (10 ml), , oil, , to knead (optional), \u25a2, \u00be, , cup, , water, , (more if needed, I use 2 tbsps more or use warm water), \u25a2, \u00bc, , teaspoon, , salt, , (optional, adjust to taste), \u25a2, 1\u00bd tablespoons  (22 ml), , melted butter or ghee, , to spread over the layers, \u25a2, 1\u00bd tablespoons (22 ml), , ghee, , or oil (to cook the parathas),  Instructions: Make Dough, \u25a2, Mix together wheat flour, salt, oil in a wide mixing bowl., \u25a2, Pour water little by little only as needed & make a stiff non sticky dough., \u25a2, Knead well to make the dough soft and pliable. If the dough is hard or dry knead with moist fingers., \u25a2, When you press down the dough with a finger, you must feel it is soft and dent easily., \u25a2, Wrap it in a moist cloth or cover it in a container and set aside for 30 mins., \u25a2, You can also grease the ball with a few drops of oil and cover., How to Make Paratha, \u25a2, Knead the dough lightly & divide to 8 parts., \u25a2, Then roll to balls & keep them covered., \u25a2, Take a few tbsp of flour to a small bowl & flour the rolling area lightly., \u25a2, Dip a ball in the flour and dust off the excess. Too much flour on the parathas can make them hard., \u25a2, Place the ball on the rolling area and flatten it slightly with fingers., \u25a2, With the help of a rolling pin begin to roll each ball to a round layer or roti of 7 inches. Do not put pressure on the dough, roll it with light hands., Make Square Paratha, \u25a2, Apply ghee or melted butter all over the paratha and fold \u2153 part of it.\u00a0(check step by step photos in the post), \u25a2, Then apply the ghee or melted butter to the folded part as well & repeat folding the other \u2153 part., \u25a2, Apply ghee or melted butter over the 3 layered long strip and fold \u2153 part of it., \u25a2, Then repeat the other \u2153 part & you will have a square., \u25a2, Sprinkle little more flour if needed to prevent sticking., \u25a2, Then roll the square further to make a 7 inch square paratha., Make Triangle Paratha, \u25a2, Apply ghee or melted butter all over the roti & fold it to half to make a half circle., \u25a2, Next apply ghee over it & repeat folding it to get a triangle shape., \u25a2, Sprinkle a bit of flour & begin to roll evenly to a triangle paratha., Fry Paratha, \u25a2, Heat a griddle until hot on a medium high flame., \u25a2, Dust off any excess flour over the parathas. Transfer paratha to the griddle gently. Cook it until you begin to see bubbles, then turn it to the other side., \u25a2, Fry on a medium high flame on the other side as well pressing down with a spatula., \u25a2, Pressing down helps the parathas to puff up and the layers get separated and get cooked through., \u25a2, Turn the parathas too and fro. Cook until brown spots appear on both the sides., \u25a2, Drizzle ghee or oil on both sides., \u25a2, Remove the paratha to a wired rack or plate lined with a clean cloth or kitchen tissue., \u25a2, Stack them one over the other to keep them soft., \u25a2, To cook the next paratha make sure the pan is hot but not extremely hot that it burns the parathas. If you see any flour on the griddle gently and carefully wipe off with a thick clean cloth., \u25a2, Serve paratha with curry or chutney or just yogurt., , , Notes, , If the dough turns sticky, sprinkle some flour and knead it., , If the dough turns hard or too stiff, then moisten your fingers and knead the paratha dough., , You can also make the dough in a food processor or stand mixer., , , , , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Paratha Recipe, How to Make Paratha, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 155, , Calories from Fat 45, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 5g, 8%, Saturated Fat 2g, 13%, Cholesterol, 9mg, 3%, Sodium, 73mg, 3%, Potassium, 33mg, 1%, Carbohydrates, 23g, 8%, Protein, 3g, 6%, , , Calcium, 5mg, 1%, Iron, 1.5mg, 8%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , This Paratha Recipe was first published in February 2016.

Serve immediately with chole., Bhatura, is one of the most famous breads from Punjab. Bhaturas are served at most, Punjabi, functions and restaurants and the size of a Bhatura could vary a great deal. At a traditional Punjabi restaurant or get-together you can expect very large Bhatura being fried right there before your eyes in a huge kadhai. The term is most often used together with Chole as 'Chole-Bhatura'. The, yeast free bhatura, Adding butter to the, yeast free bhatura, dough makes it softer while the baking soda and baking powder help it to rise and become fluffy. The curd on the other hand helps the Bhatura to rise and adds a slight tangy taste., The resting time of 1 hour is important for the dough of, Punjabi bhatura without yeast, to rise and in turn puff up while deep-frying. Remember to serve them immediately, else they might turn chewy., Tips for, bhatura (yeast free recipe), . 1. Also, take care to blot the excess oil from bhatura with a paper napkin before serving. 2.

        "Laccha Paratha": "Ingredients: , , , , 5, , How to Make Lachha Paratha with Step-by-step Photos, , , , , 6, , Notes, , , , , , , Lachha Paratha Recipe | Crisp & Flaky Layered Lachha Parantha, with step-by-step photo and video recipe. Paratha recipes are popular in North India and are served for various daily meals. However, there are region-specific layered paratha recipes with minor changes to the way it is prepared. One such Punjabi-specific layered paratha is Lachha Paratha known for its crispiness and flakiness., , Initially, I used to believe that, Lachha paratha and Kerala paratha were the same but different names. However, when I realized they were completely different, I was pleasantly surprised. I would say both are related or perhaps can be termed as cousin parathas. The main difference is the flour used in each paratha. While, in Lachha paratha, we use either a 1:1 ratio of wheat and all-purpose flour or just wheat flour. Whereas, Malabar paratha, is just plain flour with a lot of oil. Both parathas are prepared with multi-layers but the maida-based are more soft and tasty. I would say this main difference is the confusing part for most of them. Also, Laccha Paratha is good for digestion compared to Malabar Paratha due to the use of Wheat flour., , , , , , , In addition, I would like to add some more tips, suggestions, and variations to the tasty and flaky, Lachha Paratha Recipe, . Firstly, the traditional recipes are prepared with just wheat flour or atta flour. However, it can also be made with a combination of wheat and plain flour with a 1:1 ratio. Secondly, the paratha can be topped with a range of oils like vegetable oil, sunflower oil, and vanaspati, Dalda, including butter and ghee. However, adding ghee to each stage of paratha makes it healthy and tasty. Lastly, these paratha taste great when served with premium gravy-based paneer curries. But not limited and can also be served with basic dry curries., , Finally, check my other collection of, paratha recipes and collection, with this post of, Lachha Paratha Recipe, . Specifically, , Aloo cheese paratha, , , Roomali roti, , , garlic naan, , and, jowar bhakri recipe, . In addition, do check my, veg indian curries collection, for the parathas with curries like, paneer kadai, , , malai kofta, , , aloo gobhi, , and, dahi wali bhindi recipes, .

The additional layered flakiness gives it an edge compared to other stuffed parathas, thus making it more attractive and appetizing., , There are many different types of, Lachha Paratha, recipes across India. The different types of paratha are mainly derived from the combination of flour used to make it. The main hero combination is wheat and plain flour, but most commonly just wheat flour is used. The same layered paratha can also be made with just plain flour.

        "Kottu Paratha": "Ingredients: unless you make it at home. I have also shared a recipe for, Chilli Parotta, which is similar to this kothu parotta but with a Indo-Chinese touch., , About This Recipe, , I\u2019ve made a simple and quick meal without vegetables, meat and eggs. You can modify this vegetarian recipe to suit your taste or make it more filling by following my recipe notes. This is a plain version of the iconic street food and is served with onion raita., , My version is simple but bursting with flavors, healthier and easier to make. I have used homemade rotis (but rotimatic made). Feel free to use store bought parotta, whole wheat parathas or even wholemeal rotis to save time., , Making this recipe hardly takes time when you have premade, leftover or store bought parotta/ rotis. In fact, this dish is a good way to use leftover vegetable or meat gravy as well. Sometimes I also add, Kadala curry, while making kothu parotta., , Can you skip salna?, , Of course, you can skip like the way I did it! Just spice up the masala a bit with chili powder and garam masala, the same way I did., , If you are using leftover curry, reduce the liquid by heating it up on a stovetop or in the microwave. The curry has to be slightly thicker and not too runny., , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Kothu Parotta (Stepwise Photos), , Shred the parotta, , 1. Take 4 or 5 parottas and chop them roughly or tear them by hand into bite sized pieces. If using store bought frozen parottas, first cook them on a griddle as you would normally. Cool them., , , 2. This should give you 2\u00bd cups of shredded parotta. If you\u2019re using frozen parotta, , Other than the parotta or roti, and the optional egg or kurma, , Parotta: Parotta made out of maida or refined flour is the main ingredient and gives our recipe its name. You can use Kerala Malabar parotta, homemade parotta or even frozen parottas. If you can\u2019t get South Indian style parotta, use laccha paratha or roti in a pinch., , Onion and tomatoes: Along with the parotta pieces, these are key to making a tasty kothu dish. Onion-tomato masala is the base and adds a punch. To make a Jain version, skip the onion and garlic., , Mint and Coriander leaves: Fresh mint, curry and coriander leaves add to the flavor profile. If you are not using salna or kurma I highly suggest adding a few mint leaves., , Spices: This simple dish is transformed into a mouthwatering treat with the use of spices. In this recipe, I am using garam masala, fennel powder, turmeric, and red chili powder. Adjust the spices to suit your palate. Do not skip fennel powder if you are not using salna or kurma., , Fats: This recipe uses oil but you can add ghee or butter to add a rich flavour, especially if you are using homemade roti like me., , , Pro Tips, , If you\u2019re using leftover parotta or laccha paratha, moisten it with little water to soften it., Add cooked vegetables, mushrooms, panner, tofu or cooked meat to serve this as a main meal., Don\u2019t forget to mince the parotta well while it cooks., , Variations of Kothu Parotta, , Make this healthier with whole wheat rotis or chapatis. Make sure the chapatis you use are slightly thicker than usual., Skip the optional eggs for a vegetarian version. This won\u2019t affect the taste of the dish. Or use ghee and butter to enhance the flavor., Use any type of masala or curry powder to give the dish a spicy twist., Don\u2019t have leftover roti or unable to shop for readymade parotta? Use masala pooris as the kothu base., Some like to give it an Indo-Chinese touch. Add some soy sauce and chili sauce to the veggies instead of garam masala., If you can find Sri Lankan masala powder, use it to make a different version. Cut down on chili powder as this masala is pungent on its own., , , Related Recipes, , Kadala Curry Reci..., , , Chilli Parotta (C..., , , Gobi 65 (Cauliflo..., , , Vegetable Pakora ..., , , Masala Vada | Cha..., , , Masala Puri Recip..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Kothu Parotta Recipe, , , 5, from, 12, votes, , , , Kothu parotta is a popular Tamil Nadu street food where flaky shredded flatbreads are cooked in a spicy curry masala.

Begin to gently roll with a rolling pin (belan).\u00a0Sprinkle some flour. Now with the rolling pin (belan), slowly roll., , Using ziplock bag:, If you don\u2019t have a rolling pin, you can also \u201croll\u201d the makki ki roti using a ziplock bag. Place the bag on a cutting board, back of a metal tray, or on a surface you can move., , Place the dough ball in the bag. Press it slightly with your hands until flat. The using the rolling pin roll gently to about a size as thin as a tortilla. Move the rolling board and roll again. This is to ensure that all the sides of the makki roti are evenly rolled., , , 9.\u00a0Roll into small- to medium-sized rounds.\u00a0They should be roughly the size of a phulka or chapati, but not very thin. The roti should not break if you handle them carefully.\u00a0If the rolling pin is sticking, add more flour as required., , , , 10. Makki roti can also be made by patting the dough.\u00a0To start, sprinkle some maize flour on the dough ball and on the rolling board., , , 11. Now, with your fingers, gently press and pat the dough. As you press the dough, also move it clockwise., , , 12. Continue to press and pat the dough till you get a neat roti. Do not make thin but slightly thick roti. When the dough is patted, the edges won\u2019t be as even as if you had rolled it; this is fine., , If you are experienced in making the roti by pressing the palms of your hands together the way our grandmothers and great-grandmothers used to, feel free to make the makki roti this way too., , , Cook Makki Ki Roti, , 13. Now spread about 1 to 2 teaspoons of ghee or a neutral flavored oil on a hot tawa or skillet or frying pan. Cook the roti on medium to medium-high heat., , , 14. Gently place the makki di roti on the tawa. If there is a crack in the roti dough, then gently pat that portion with a few drops of water to seal it shut., , , 15.

Drizzle a bit of ghee on the sides whilst cooking the roti., , If the dough is kneaded well, the makki di roti will start puffing up. Press the edges with a spatula so that the edges are also cooked well. Continue making all rotis this way until the dough is over., , If you like multi-tasking, you can roll and roast the rotis simultaneously. If you prefer working in stages, you can also roll all the makki ki rotis first. Cover them with a kitchen napkin to keep them from drying out, and then roast them one by one., , , Serve the makki ki roti hot with saag\u00a0and jaggery cubes. We also like to add some white butter on top of the makki di roti while serving; that\u2019s how they are relished and served in Punjabi families., , , FAQs, , Can I substitute Mexican masa harina for the makki ka atta?, , While I myself have not tried it, I have heard from several of my readers that they have made this substitution with very good results., , , Instead of rolling these out, do you think a tortilla press would work?, , Yes, it would work!, , , Can I make these ahead of time?, , Makki di roti, much like other types of bread, are best served hot or warm. That said, you can make the dough a day earlier and refrigerate it. Cover the dough with a clingfilm or place in an air-tight container so that it does not become dry., , , Can I freeze makki ki roti?, , Sure! Once cooked, separate the rotis with pieces of parchment. Place them in a zip top bag and remove as much air as possible. They should keep for up to 2 months in the freezer. To serve, warm them on a tawa until heated through., , , How do I keep my makki ki roti from breaking when I roll them?, , These flatbreads are a little harder to roll than other types because maize flour doesn\u2019t have gluten. The gluten creates long strands of protein that help hold everything together. Have you ever rolled out a dough for it to spring back somewhat? That\u2019s the gluten at work!, Using very hot water to make the dough helps somewhat. I also recommend rolling them between pieces of parchment paper or in a zip top bag to help keep things together. Finally, don\u2019t be afraid to use your hands to help press and shape the roti as needed., If you are *still* having a tough time, you can add a bit of wheat flour (atta) to the dough before rolling, which will add some gluten to help guide you. That said, and it will slightly change the flavor of the final product., , , , Indian Breads, Roti Recipe | Chapati Recipe | Phulka Recipe (3 Ways), Indian Breads, Missi Roti Recipe (Gram Flour Flatbread), Vegan Recipes, Bajra Roti | Easy Bajre ki Roti (Bakra Bhakri), Indian Breads, Jowar Roti, , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

I was thrilled when I found out about maki ki roti and found them easier to make than my beginner rotis! We use harina de ma\u00edz (corn flour) and it\u2019s easier to knead than corn meal which the granules are bigger. I brought my mother in law my grandmas old cast iron tortilla presser. We also cover it with ziploc and just use slight amount of pressure to the handle to make perfect round tortillas. My mother in law was thrilled and had fun using it., And yes, they are heavier than rotis and corn really does not have the great nutritional properties that atta has., Also warm water helps., Your recipes have really made me a better and more confident Indian cook and I have impressed my mother in law a few occasions with your help., Gracias! (Thank you), , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Jun 03, 2017 at 11:01 pm, , , , , Welcome Dani. Glad to read your feedback.  tortilla presser is a very good idea. Thanks for sharing this information., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , mamta, , says:, , , , Nov 22, 2016 at 6:03 pm, , , , , you can add grated mooli or methi leaves while making the dough for extra flavour, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Nov 22, 2016 at 6:15 pm, , , , , thanks mamta for this suggestion., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Kaur Harsimrat, , says:, , , , Dec 14, 2015 at 6:21 pm, , , , , My mom usually makes them at home \u2013 perfectly  round ones. The trick is that you have to use warm water while flattening them on palm(she makes them on palms) and I agree more water while kneading helps in round rotis. Also elder ones at home say that maize flour is lighter than wheat flour its the sarso ka saag that makes the meal heavy otherwise makki ki roti is light for our stomach. My grandmother usually eats them as she thinks these are light and easy to digest., , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Dec 14, 2015 at 8:04 pm, , , , , agree on warm water for kneading. my mother in law says that makki ka atta is slightly difficult to digest and says that ajwain must be added to the dough. we also have makki ki rotis with tea at times and i do feel they are heavy than chapatis. i can\u2019t make them perfectly round and it takes practice. i only make them during winters and that too with sarson ka saag and on occasions with some mooli chutney or tea., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Meena, , says:, , , , Jan 29, 2015 at 12:05 pm, , , , , Hi.. I tried this today and came out very well, but the only thing is my flour is not yellow color, its labelled as sorghum flour ( Jowar ki roti ) so i was wondering both are same or different?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Jan 29, 2015 at 9:05 pm, , , , , thanks meena. makki ki roti is maize flour and is always yellow in color. the colour resembles the colour of besan/gram flour. both are different. sorghum flour has creamish color., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Mina Valyani, , says:, , , , Jan 19, 2015 at 12:16 am, , , , , thanks for the recipe.  First time i made this \u2013 truly wonderful.  My makki rotis looked just like yours.  the only difference was I did not use a rolling pin to roll them out.  I flattened them in the bag by hand and this was before reading the other comments.  I had them with your recipe for Sarson ka saag \u2013 this was made for the first time too!!.

Your recipe is very much like tortillas. I would recommend trying what the Latinos call \u201cmasa harina\u201d next time you are looking for corn meal/flour. A package might also say \u201cmasa de maize\u201d. Masa harina is corn flour/meal that has been made into hominy first then ground into a flour and dried. It is more nutritious that just plain ground corn and has a better texture for making tortillas. Latinos will use rolling pins to make tortillas; some will also use a tortilla press. They sometimes also use sheets of plastic to keep the dough from sticking as you do. I recommend looking into a tortilla press if you can. I really learn a lot from your website. Your education in Food Science really comes through. I have also studied Food Science so I know., , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , May 20, 2014 at 8:03 pm, , , , , in india, locally we only get the yellow colored maize flour. the other colored ones are only available in major indian cities and all of them are imported from other countries and very expensive. i have read about masa harina. in fact was even thinking of making them from the yellow maize flour that we get here. thanks for sharing the info on masa harina and tortilla. also thanks for your kind words., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Chandru Gurnani, , says:, , , , Apr 29, 2014 at 9:45 pm, , , , , Hello Amit try the recipe with increasing the amount of water from 1/2 cup to 1-1.25 cups of water. The rotis will come out round circular in shape and won\u2019t be too dry to eat. Using a plastic sheet is a good idea and if you increase the water content then you won\u2019t need a rolling pin instead you can roll it out with the finger tips or even the back of a thali/plate on a flat surface. Objective is to make the dough very soft and if it dries out then wet your hands again and knead it a little bit more., , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , May 01, 2014 at 12:55 am, , , , , thanks for the suggestion and tips. i usually make the dough soft, but still that its easier to roll. i will try with your suggestion of adding some more water and making the rotis with the palm of the hand., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Janani, , says:, , , , Apr 23, 2014 at 9:28 pm, , , , , Nice it helped me in my cooking my friends told it was fantastic, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Apr 24, 2014 at 7:02 pm, , , , , thanks janani for the positive feedback., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , hetal, , says:, , , , Sep 30, 2013 at 5:33 pm, , , , , Hi Dassana,, i went thru a lot of your recepies today for the first time.
