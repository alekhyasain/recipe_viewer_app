My kids love this!, , More paratha recipes here, Mix Veg Paratha, Palak Paratha, Methi Paratha, Paneer Paratha, Aloo Paratha, , , , Photo Guide, , , 1. Add half cup wheat flour and a pinch of salt to a mixing bowl., , , , 2. Pour 3 tablespoons warm water and begin to form a soft non-sticky dough, adding more water as required. Add half a teaspoon\u00a0oil. Knead it again to a soft dough., , , , 3. Smear a few drops of oil to the dough. Cover and set aside until you prepare the rest. Chop 1 very small onion, 1 green chili and a handful of coriander leaves. If making for kids omit the chili and use black pepper. If you want you can also add 2 to 3 tablespoons of grated carrots., , , , 4. Divide the dough to 2 equal portions and roll to smooth balls. Flour the rolling area lightly and coat the ball with flour on both the sides. Flatten it and begin to roll with light hands., , , , 5. Roll it to a round 6 inch roti. If you do not want to make layered paratha, just omit the next 3 steps. To make layered paratha, apply \u00bc teaspoon oil all over., , , , 6. Fold it. Smear little more oil again., , , , 7. Fold it again., , , , 8. Roll it to a triangle or any shape you can. If the paratha sticks to the counter, sprinkle flour and roll. This way make both the parathas., , , , Cook the Paratha, , 9. Heat a pan on a medium flame until hot enough (not smoking hot). Take the paratha to your hand and dust it lightly to get rid of the excess flour. Transfer to the pan and cook until bubbles begin to appear. Using a turner, turn it to the other side., , , , 10. With in few seconds the paratha begins to puff up., , , , 11. Toast on both the sides till brown spots appear. Press down on the edges to cook all over evenly. I did not use oil or ghee at this stage since it gets coated with oil at the last step. If you want you may use. This way first cook all the parathas and remove to a plate., , , , Prepare Egg, , 12. Transfer the paratha to a plate. Set the pan aside to cool down a bit. A very hot tawa can burn the egg without cooking properly. Prepare the egg mixture. Mix half of the onions, chilies, coriander leaves, pepper, turmeric and salt in a bowl. Break the egg., , , , 13. Whisk the egg mixture until frothy using a fork or a small whisk., , , , 14. Add oil to the pan, when it is just hot, pour the egg mixture. Let it cook on a medium flame till the egg is almost cooked but slightly gooey on top. This helps the paratha to stick well with the egg. You can use 1 egg for each paratha or 1 egg for 2 parathas., , , , 15. Place the paratha over the egg. Press it gently., , , , 16. Lastly turn it and cook on the other side as well for 1 to 2 minutes to ensure egg is cooked completely on the edges. egg paratha gets coated well with oil at this stage. Repeat to make the next one., , , , Egg paratha doesn\u2019t need any accompaniment. But can be served with any chutney and a vegetable salad. This egg paratha can be served plain or with some, pudina chutney, or with, green chutney, or masala tea., , , , , Related Recipes, , Savory French Toa..., , , Aloo Paratha Reci..., , , Mix veg paratha (..., , , Palak Paratha (Sp..., , , Methi Paratha Rec..., , , Lauki Paratha (Bo..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Egg Paratha Recipe (Anda Paratha), , , 4.94, from, 44, votes, , , , Anda paratha are whole wheat flatbreads topped with a egg mixture and cooked to perfection.

Reserve the other half for the next paratha. Break an egg to the same bowl. Whisk well until frothy., \u25a2, Make the Egg Paratha:, Pour a teaspoon oil on the pan.
