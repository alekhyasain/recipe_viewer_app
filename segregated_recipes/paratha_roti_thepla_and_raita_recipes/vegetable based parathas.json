        "Palak Paratha": "Ingredients: , , , 5. Knead until the dough is soft and pliable. Smear few drops of oil. Cover and set aside for 30 minutes., , , , 6. Divide the dough to equal sized balls and set aside. You will get about 6 to 7 parathas depending on the size and thickness., , , , Make palak paratha, , 7. Sprinkle little flour over the rolling area and then over the ball as well. Flatten a bit and roll them. Lightly sprinkle flour as needed to prevent the paratha from sticking. Roll to a neither too thick or too thin palak paratha. If you want to make layered paratha you can check this post on, plain parathas, ., , , , 8. Heat a tawa or griddle on a high flame. When the griddle is hot enough, gently lift the palak paratha and dust off all the excess flour and transfer it to the griddle., , , , 9. Very soon you will begin to see bubbles., , , , 10. Flip the palak paratha to the other side and gently press down with a spatula so the paratha puffs well. Smear 1 teaspoon ghee over the paratha., , , , 11. Gently press the paratha to help it puff up. It may not puff if it is too thin or doesn\u2019t get enough heat. Clean up the tawa to remove any dry flour before you begin to roast the next one., , , , Lastly stack spinach paratha to keep them soft. Place them over a kitchen towel. When they cool down, place them in a box to keep them soft for hours., , , , Pro Tips, , , I prefer to puree the palak first and then add it to the flour. However you can also add them finely chopped. Since I have fussy kids I do prefer to blend them., , Avoid adding stalks of spinach as they sometimes lend a bitter or metallic taste., , I do not blanch the palak or any leaf greens. But if you are on a low oxalate diet, then yes do add the spinach to boiling water and leave for 1 to 2 mins. Then add them to cold water. Drain and use them., , Adjust the amount of spice powders to suit your taste.

Use water only if needed., \u25a2, Add the puree to the flour along with salt and spice powders., \u25a2, Knead together to make a dough., \u25a2, If the dough turns sticky, just sprinkle more flour & knead to a non sticky dough., \u25a2, If the dough turns too dry then, sprinkle water & knead., \u25a2, Add little oil and knead well to make a soft pliable dough., \u25a2, Set this aside for 20 to 30 minutes. Make 8 equal sized balls. Cover them., How to make Palak Paratha, \u25a2, Flour the rolling area and flatten a ball. Sprinkle flour., \u25a2, Roll it to make slightly thick palak paratha., \u25a2, Sprinkle flour over the paratha as needed to prevent sticking. It has to be slightly thicker than roti., \u25a2, Heat a tawa until hot enough.\u00a0Transfer a paratha to the tawa., \u25a2, When the paratha begins to get bubbles over it., \u25a2, Flip it to the other side.

Stack the palak parathas to keep them soft., \u25a2, Serve palak paratha with chutney, dal or curry.

        "Lauki Paratha": "Ingredients: , , , , , , Jump To Recipe, , , , , 197, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , There are 2 kinds of parathas \u2013 stuffed and the non-stuffed. While the stuffed parathas need some practice, the non-stuffed ones don\u2019t require practice or any special skills except for rolling the dough evenly with light hands., , About Lauki Paratha, , These lauki paratha are not stuffed so they are easier to make. You just make the dough and roll portions to round parathas. These are toasted on a griddle with ghee or oil. They can be made thick or thin to your liking. These can be served hot or cold with a chutney, pickle or yogurt. But they taste good on their own if the dough is spiced well., , My boys are fussy to eat bottle gourd. So I often make these and the, Handvo, which also uses grated bottle gourd. These can be made simple with just atta, bottle gourd, coriander leaves, chilies, garam masala, red chili powder and salt., , A lot of times I also use fenugreek leaves or spinach and turmeric (for color) for a variation (as seen in the first picture). You can also make lauki thepla by replacing some of the atta with bajra or jowar and besan. These keep good in the school and office lunch boxes. They can be eaten with plain yogurt., , If you plan to make these in the early morning, you can grate the bottle gourd the previous night and keep it ready in the refrigerator. Making the dough in the stand mixer or the food processor simplifies the task. You can roll the dough to parathas immediately after kneading the dough. These lauki paratha keep good in the refrigerator for 2 days and can be steamed to reheat., , You can also make these with grated zucchini, carrots or beetroots., , Similar recipes,, Vegetable paratha, Methi paratha, Palak paratha, Beetroot paratha, , , Photo Guide, , moisture begins to release from bottle gourd and the flour binds with its own moisture. But if the gourd is not juicy, you may need to sprinkle little water to make a soft dough. Add oil and knead again to a pliable dough. Set aside for 30 minutes if you have times else knead it a little longer and use it right away., , , , 4. Divide the dough to 8 portions and keep them covered until used up for rolling. Flour the rolling area with little flour, flatted a dough ball and dip in the bowl with flour to coat it. Shake off to remove the excess. Place it on the rolling area., , , , 5. With a rolling pin roll to a thin or thick paratha to your preference. I roll to a thin 7 to 8 inch roti because the gourd does not cook in the thicker parathas.

I bought this vegetable without knowing what it was, I hated the taste of it in a curry. So this was a good recipe for the leftover bottle gourd. I don\u2019t have a grater, so I cut it a bit chunkier than your photos. It turned out more like a pakoda than a paratha, but still tasted great!, , P.S: I admire that you don\u2019t advertise any brands here, but do you have a list of \u201cessential kitchen items\u201d for beginners/intermediate/advanced? I haven\u2019t needed a grater for 6 months of cooking, but I think now I\u2019m moving into \u2018intermediate\u2019 territory where a few things like a grater, mixer and oven would be nice to have., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , swasthi, , , , , , Reply to, Gazala, , , , April 27, 2020 4:26 am, , , , , , Hi Gazala,, You are welcome!

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: Recipe card, , This idea of making capsicum cheese paratha flashed when I read about a review in FB about Annalakshmi at Chennai., , The review had the menu which they served for aadi perukku. It had this capsicum cheese paratha. So the instant I read about it, I decided I am gonna try it., , Because, its an awesome combination, capsicum and cheese are made for each other!\u00a0 I have had lunch buffet in Annalakshmi few time here in SG., , And we order food for Aj\u2019s Birthday party from Annalakshmi every time we plan his party., , Here they run this restaurant for a noble cause, so we are double happy for not only tasty food, for something good too., , And about this paratha, sure the kids at home are gonna love this simply for the combination. So why not try this for your family and I am sure you yourself would love it too., , For an eye appealing result, I have used colourful capsicum which we get easily here as 3-in-1 pack called traffic light! You can prepare with any one of the color., , colorful capsicum cheese paratha, , Top tip, , I get many queries that they have problem with rolling the paratha without sticking. Here are few things that might help apart from the video., , Mainly the, dough consistency, . Tight dough or too much sticky dough will be a disaster. So follow the 1 cup (heaped atta) flour and \u00bd cup water measurement., Depending on the brand you use, the water quantity varies. So it's just for guidance., Too tight dough, - Stuffing will squeeze out from paratha., Troubleshooting, : Dip your hands in water and knead until the dough loosens., Sticky dough, - You cannot roll as it will stick and while rolling capsicum sticks to rolling pin and board., Troubleshooting, : Sprinkle 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour and knead dough to make it non sticky. Use lots of flour while spreading. I use all purpose flour for dusting which will not give you dry paratha. If you are okay with using it, recommend the same., , Chopping capsicum, - Use a really sharp knife and chop it really fine. This way, it is easy for rolling., , Dough preparation, - Firstly, mix salt, flour and water using spatula roughly. Secondly, mix grease your hands and knead dough., , You will apparently get it stuck to hands but just gently gather to form a dough without dry flour spots., , Wash your hands, grease again and smoothen the dough briefly., , Grease surface and give resting time, minimum 10 to 15 minutes., , Knead again to smoothen, it will be easier now. Again divide, smoothen the ball, and keep covered all the times., , Spreading paratha, - Seal completely like your do for modak, take off excess dough as you see in my video., , First dust it and flatten with hands. Again dust before rolling. Each time you can sprinkle dough to avoid sticking., , Never rest the paratha spread. Once you roll, cook it simultaneously., , , Firstly mix flour, salt with water (\u00bd cup approx) and prepare dough. Keep aside. Chop capsicum finely. Defrost cheese and add it to the capsicum along with chilli flakes and mix well., , , 2. Now, knead the dough and divide into 5 equal balls. Roll out and keep the capsicum mixture in middle., , , 3. Close it by pinching towards middle and roll out carefully both sides with generous dusting into thick parathas., , , 4. Cook over hot tawa with oil drizzled. Cook in medium flame to ensure even cooking. You can press gently with spatula for even browning., , , I really wanted to show how it was inside, but I could not resist myself finishing the parathas after clicking. Tasted great with, boondi raita, and pickle., , Capsicum cheese paratha is one of the best kid's lunch box idea, , Recipe card, , , , , Print, , Pin, , 5, from, 5, votes, , , Colorful capsicum cheese paratha, , , Capsicum cheese paratha is a perfect kids meal or lunch box idea.

You can press gently with spatula for even browning., Repeat to finish all., , Video, , Notes, , The water quantity is only a guidance and it may vary plus / minus 1 or 2 tbsp., , Give standing time of atleast 15 mins for the dough to become smooth. Knead again after resting for smooth dough., , I used both red and green capsicum, to make more appealing for kids., , You can add chilli powder or pepper powder instead chilli flakes., , Do not reduce cheese as it gives a great taste along with capsicum, , I used grated mixed cheese I bought for making pizza.You can replace cheese with paneer too., , The cheese melts when its being cooked, so when it cools, it will get solidified again., , , , , Youtube, Do you like short videos?, Subscribe now!, , , , , , Instagram, Mention, @rakskitchen, or tag, #rakskitchen, if you have tried this recipe., , , Other, Buckwheat waffles recipe, eggless gluten free waffles, Cabbage rice recipe, easy cabbage rice, Lemon semiya, lemon vermicelli upma recipe, How to make schezwan fried rice in three steps, Comments, , , , , , sangeetaskitchen, , says, , , August 12, 2013 at 9:15 am, , , , Very different paratha raji....looks tempting....will try very soon....., , , Reply, , , , , , , , AparnaRajeshkumar, , says, , , August 12, 2013 at 9:15 am, , , , i tried i tried long time back \ud83d\ude42 it was yummy ! and the combo is just awesome !!!!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Akila, , says, , , August 12, 2013 at 9:17 am, , , , Nice combo...

As I was grating moolis and filling the parathas, the smell made me doubt how the parathas would turn out and if the kids would eat them. Like mentioned in the recipe, it is quite tricky to roll these parathas as they break out easily. With all the tips and warnings, it was not that difficult. I had not added salt to the grated mooli but added more salt to the dough to compensate. Even then, the moolis gave out so much water and I had to squeeze the water out. I didn\u2019t add green chillies as kids would not be able to handle the spice but followed all other steps like sprinkling red chilly powder and garam masala. The final result was unbelievable. The parathas were so delicious!, , A thumbs up from the kids too who were tasting mooli for the first time and loved the parathas., , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Dec 31, 2017 at 8:08 pm, , , , , Thanks Deepa for this awesome feedback on mooli parathas. glad to know that everyone liked them. we love to have these parathas during winters. you can try using green chillies which are not very spicy or hot. they add a good flavor in these parathas., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Kshama, , says:, , , , Sep 14, 2017 at 7:22 pm, , , , , Hi, i am an ok cook but i have tried a lot of your recipes Dassana and they have all turned out beautiful.

        "Cabbage Paratha": "Ingredients: , , , , 5, , How to Make Cabbage Paratha with Step-by-step Photos, , , , , 6, , Notes, , , , , , , Cabbage Paratha Recipe | Patta Gobhi Ka Paratha | Patta Gobi Paratha, with step-by-step photo and video recipe. Paratha recipes are very common across India and are made with myriad vegetables. Most of these parathas are made similarly, with spiced vegetables stuffed inside or mixed with wheat flour bread. One such hugely popular bread is cabbage paratha or patta gobhi ka paratha known for its flavour and taste., , I have always been a huge fan of paratha recipes and I make it regularly. I make this with almost all the vegetables I find in the market or my fridge. This can be mainly made for dinner or even for lunch boxes. The biggest use case for these parathas is that it does not require any side dish compared to roti or chapati. I like the, patta gobhi ka paratha, is that it does not require pressure cooking. For example, if you are planning, aloo paratha, or, mooli paratha, , it has to be pressure cooked and then followed up by saut\u00e9ing it with spices. In this recipe, the finely chopped cabbage leaves are spiced and directly mixed with bread flour for a simple yet effective paratha recipe., , , , , , , Anyway, I would like to highlight some tips, suggestions, and variations for a perfect, patta gobhi ka paratha, . Firstly, in this paratha, I have used white cabbage or white patta gobhi. But you can make the same paratha with all the other varieties of cabbage-like, purple, , green, red, and also spring greens. Secondly, I chopped cabbage finely using a food processor, which makes it simple and easy. You can use a knife to chop the cabbage finely but can be time-consuming. You may have to take extra precautions if you are using a food processor as it may ooze out moisture. Lastly, serve these parathas with either a choice of pickle or with dahi/raita. It also tastes great when served with any choice of curry., , Finally, I request you to check my other related, Paratha Recipe Collection, with this post on the, cabbage paratha recipe, . It mainly includes recipes like, masala paratha, , , garlic paratha, , , tomato paratha, , , aloo paratha, , , parotta, , , pudina paratha, , , beetroot paratha, , , suji ka paratha, , , palak paratha, , , mix veg paratha, . in addition, do visit my other related recipes collection,, , , Curry Recipes Collection, , Paneer Recipes Collection, , Sandwich Recipes Collection, , , , , Must Read:, , , , , , , , , , , , sweets recipes, Gulab Jamun Recipe \u2013 Soft with..., , , , , , , , , , , , , paneer recipes, Matar Paneer Pulao Recipe | Kaju..., , , , , , , , , , , , , starters or entree, Cheesy Garlic Bread Recipe \u2013 Dominos..., , , , , , , , , , 00:02:12, , , , dal recipes, Dal Makhani Recipe Restaurant Style in..., , , , , , , , , , , , , curry recipes, Matar Paneer Recipe | Dhaba Style..., , , , , , , , , , , , , paneer recipes, Dahi Ke Kabab Recipe | Hung..., , , , , About Cabbage Paratha, , It is a spiced vegetable paratha recipe made with cabbage grated mixed into the wheat flour dough. In other words, , Cabbage Paratha, or, Patta Gobi Paratha, is a simple and easy spiced bread with the goodness of cabbage shred. It can be a perfect choice for any day of the meal which includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Yet it is more commonly prepared for lunch boxes or tiffin boxes for the fact that it does not need any sides. It tastes great when served with simple raita, pickle, or any type of curries., , There are not many variations to this simple paratha. It can be either prepared as cabbage roti with cabbage masala mixed with wheat flour. Or the cabbage masala stuffed inside wheat flour pockets like any other traditional paratha. I feel stuffed style may not be required as it may complicate things. Yet it is individual preference and, Cabbage Paratha, is open-ended bread. Also, it can be made with any different types of cabbage making it an ideal choice., , Video Recipe, , , Recipe Card For Caabbage Paratha, , , , , , , , , Cabbage Paratha Recipe | Patta Gobhi Ka Paratha | Patta Gobi Paratha, , , HEBBARS KITCHEN, , , Easy Cabbage Paratha Recipe | Patta Gobhi Ka Paratha | Patta Gobi Paratha, , , 5, from, 231, votes, , , , , , , Email, , Tweet, , Share, , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , , Save Recipe, Saved!, , , , , , Prep Time, 10, minutes, , mins, Cook Time, 30, minutes, , mins, Total Time, 40, minutes, , mins, , , , , , , Course, paratha, Cuisine, north indian, , , , , , Servings, 12, , Paratha, Calories, 103, , kcal, , , , , , , 1x, 2x, 3x, \u25a2, 2, , tsp, , oil, \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , cumin, \u25a2, \u00bc, , tsp, , turmeric, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , chilli powder, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , cumin powder, \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , coriander powder, \u25a2, 1, , tsp, , garam masala, \u25a2, 2, , cup, , cabbage, , , finely chopped, \u25a2, \u00bd, , tsp, , salt, \u25a2, 2, , cup, , wheat flour, \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , besan / gram flour, \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , sesame, \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , coriander, , , chopped, \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , curd, \u25a2, water, , , for kneading, \u25a2, ghee, , , for roasting,  Instructions: , Firstly, in a pan heat 2 tsp oil and splutter\u00a01 tsp cumin., Keeping the flame on low, add\u00a0\u00bc tsp turmeric, \u00bd tsp chilli powder, \u00bd tsp cumin powder, 1 tsp coriander powder, and 1 tsp garam masala., Saute on low flame until the spices turn aromatic., Add 2 cup cabbage and saute well., Now add\u00a0\u00bd tsp salt and saute until the cabbage is cooked well.

So how is this different? This is a, Paratha recipe, with stuffed pizza sauce & veggies, topped with cheese. This is on the heavier side and ideal to serve for a meal., , Just like the way a pizza is served hot, this paratha too is best served hot. You can also accompany this with some light soup. I mostly make, Sweet corn soup, or vegetable, pasta soup, to go with these pizza parathas., , You don\u2019t need any chutney or pickle with this paratha if you use a really good pizza sauce. I use this, homemade pizza sauce, which is very flavorful and lightly spicy., , The taste and flavor of this pizza paratha comes out very very good only by using a good pizza sauce. You can also make the sauce ahead and refrigerate it for about 2 to 3 weeks. However you can also use store bought sauce for convenience., , I have toasted the pizza paratha on the tawa but you can also put it in a preheated oven for 2 to 3 minutes towards the end to brown the cheese slightly. I have used mozzarella cheese, you can also use four cheese or pizza cheese, grated, cubed or slices as desired., , For more pizza varieties, do check, Veg pizza, Tawa pizza, Bread pizza, , , Photo Guide, , How to Make Pizza Paratha, , 1. Add wheat flour and salt to a mixing bowl. Pour water little by little and begin to make a dough., , , , 2. Pour \u00bd tbsp oil and knead until the dough becomes soft and pliable. You can also skip the oil. Cover this & keep aside the veggies and pizza sauce is ready. To make the sauce at home refer the link mentioned in the intro of this post., , , , 3. Divide the dough to 6 equal parts. Sprinkle some flour on the rolling area. Flatten a ball and dust some flour on both the sides., , , , , 4. Roll it to a round or square shaped roti.

Leave the paratha on a low flame till the cheese melts. Make sure the bottom doesn\u2019t get burnt. At this stage you can skip cooking on the tawa. Just put the paratha on a wire rack in the preheated oven or microwave until the cheese melts., , , , Slice the pizza paratha and serve hot., , , , , 1.

The only way is to give him lighter & soupy foods. Avoid giving roti or paratha. You need to remind for every bite that he has to chew. I do not have a diet plan for 5 years old. You will have to include 3 meals, 2 snacks and 2 large fruit servings in a day. You can also reduce milk and check if that is causing the problem.

        "Mooli Thepla": "Ingredients: , , , , , , , , on a medium flame, using a little oil, till it turns golden brown in colour from both the sides. Serve hot with chunda., , A traditional flatbread recipe from the heart of Gujarat, , mooli thepla, is made from a delectable dough of whole wheat flour reinforced with grated radish along with its leaves too., , Curds are added to enhance the texture and flavour of the, mooli paratha, , while chilli powder provides an enjoyable spiciness. Note that no water is used to make the dough. Curds, a little bit of oil, and the juice that comes out of the radish are the fluids that bind the dough together., , To make, healthy radish thepla, , we suggest you reduce the amount of oil added to knead the dough to 2 tsp and cook each thepla with \u00bd tsp of oil. They can then be relished by, weight-watchers, , , heart, patients and even, diabetics, . There is a lot of nutrition to gather in these theplas. The, radish leaves, are a good source of, vitamin A, and, vitamin C, , which act as antioxidants and safeguard our skin, hair, eyes and gums. The, white radish, is also rich in, fibre, , thus making these theplas gut-friendly., , Tips for, mooli thepla, . 1. Buy the perfect radish to make these theplas. Radishes with their leaves intact, usually tied in bunches are the best. If the leaves are attached, they should be crisp and green. The radish white roots should be hard and solid, with a smooth, unblemished surface. 2. The dough of the theplas should be soft, to get soft theplas. 3.
