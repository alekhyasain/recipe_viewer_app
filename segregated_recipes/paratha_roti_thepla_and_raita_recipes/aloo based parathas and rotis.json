        "Aloo Paratha": "Ingredients: , Potatoes, : Choosing the right kind of potatoes to make these parathas is very important. Some kind of potatoes turn too mushy and sticky after boiling. Avoid using such potatoes. Avoid using newly harvested potatoes. Old potatoes, Yukon Gold & Russet are suitable for parathas., , Spices, : Most people make aloo paratha with minimal spices like cumin, coriander powder and red chilli powder. The combination of spices I have used here makes the parathas so flavorful that your home will be filled with a delicate aroma while frying., , However if you do not have or don\u2019t prefer any particular spice, then you can simply skip it. You can also increase or decrease the spices to suit your taste., , Ghee, : Aloo parathas are pan fried mostly with a generous amount of ghee as it imparts that smoky aroma and flaky texture. If you do not eat ghee then use any regular oil., , Variations, , 1.You can also temper the spices before adding to the mashed potatoes. To do this, heat 1 tbsp oil or ghee in a small pan. Add ginger and green chilies. Saute for 30 seconds and then add all the spice powders and salt. Turn off and add this to the mashed potatoes., , Even without the tempering the aloo parathas will be great as the stuffing gets steam cooked while frying., , 2. Some people also add onions to the stuffing. They are added raw or sauteed in oil until they lose the raw smell., , , Related Recipes, , Gobi Paratha Reci..., , , Chapati Recipe (I..., , , Paratha Recipe, , , Palak Paratha (Sp..., , , Methi Paratha Rec..., , , Paneer Paratha Re..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Aloo Paratha Recipe | Potato Stuffed Paratha, , , 5, from, 203, votes, , , , These stuffed parathas are made with spiced potato filling.

Also divide the dough to 8 parts. Keep the dough covered., How to Make Aloo Paratha, \u25a2, Roll a dough ball in your palms to smooth. Lightly sprinkle some flour on the rolling area. Flatten the dough ball and dip it in some flour., \u25a2 Instructions: , I have shared 3 ways to roll the parathas (pics below). Take a look first to see which one looks easier to you., , 8. Sprinkle little flour on the rolling area. Smoothen a dough ball and dip it in flour. Flatten it and roll to a 4 inch round roti/disc., , , , 9. Place a spiced potato ball in the center and bring the sides up., , , , 10. Press down the stuffing to the center and bring the sides higher giving it a cup shape. If the aloo stuffing is sticky, then smear your fingers generously with some flour., , , , 11. Bring the sides higher by simply rotating the whole thing on your hand in clock-wise direction. The dough gets stretched by itself and comes over the stuffing. (check video), , , , 12. Repeat this step of pushing the aloo inside and bringing the sides higher by rotating until the edges come over to the top., , , , 13. Join all the edges well to ensure no filling is visible. I do not remove any excess dough, instead press it down back to the ball., , , , 14. Dip this ball in flour on both the sides and gently flatten it with your fingers. This is very important so the filling is evenly spread all over the paratha., , , , 15. Place the sealed side down on the rolling area and gently roll it evenly without putting pressure. Do not roll the aloo paratha continuously. Instead rotate in clock-wise direction a little after every 4 to 6 rolls to ensure it does not tear or get stuck., , You can make as thin or thick you like. I make mine thin and about 8 to 9 inches. If you see the filling coming out while rolling, then apply some flour there. Sprinkle flour only as needed and avoid using excess., , , , , I had shot these pictures in 2015 but never got to share it on the blog. The stuffing I made here is by tempering the spices in oil first and then I added it to the mashed potatoes. It is on the hotter side with more chilli powder., , Place the aloo stuffing in a 5 inch roti. Then make pleats and bring all the edges on top. Gently join them and pinch off the excess dough. Flatten slightly and dip in flour. Flatten it again to a 4 inch disc with your fingers to spread the filling evenly. Then roll it to as big as you can., , , , , you will be able to make only 6 large parathas. So divide the dough to 12 and stuffing to 6 parts., , , , Fry Aloo Paratha, , 16. After you are done rolling 3 to 4 paranthas, heat a griddle on a medium high flame. When the pan is hot enough, dust off excess flour from the aloo paratha & gently transfer it to the griddle. Within 2 minutes, you will see bubbles. Turn it to the other side., , , , 17. Press down gently with a spatula. You will see the aloo paratha begins to puff. Drizzle some ghee or oil. I add about 1 teaspoon ghee., , , , 18. Turn it to & fro to the other side and drizzle more ghee. Cook pressing down on the edges with a spatula so they cook well. Well-cooked parathas will leave your entire house filled with a great aroma. When you see golden to light brown spots on the aloo paratha, remove to a plate., , , , 19. To fry the next one, ensure the pan is hot enough and not extremely hot. Keep regulating the flame to medium or low as needed so the parathas don\u2019t burn. Place a clean cloth in a container or arrange a cooling rack & Stack the parathas to keep them moist., , Serve Aloo Paratha with pickle or yogurt. You can also top your parathas with butter. We love them with this, Mint chutney, or Cilantro /, coriander chutney, ., , , , Pro Tips, , Firstly boiling potatoes, the right way is the key to make the best aloo parathas. Boil them just until fork tender, meaning they are just cooked and not overcooked. Soggy potatoes will make a sticky and very moist stuffing which is not good to make parathas., , Mashing or grating potatoes, properly is also very important. There should be no chunks of potatoes left in the mash as they will tear the parathas. Do not over mash to the extent they become pasty. So you can also grate them rather than mashing to avoid pasty texture., , Stuffing the parathas, , Flattening and spreading the stuffing, after sealing the spiced aloo in the dough is what makes the aloo paratha perfect. This avoids the parathas from tearing and spreads the filling evenly., , Lastly frying parathas, on a low heat will make them hard. Cook them on a moderately medium high heat so they cook well. Also regulating the flame as needed is very important so they don\u2019t burn., , , , Preparation, \u25a2, Boil potatoes just until fork tender without making them mushy. To pressure cook in traditional cooker, cook for 3 to 4 whistles depending on the size of potatoes. In instant pot I pressure cooked for 5 mins since I used medium sized potatoes., \u25a2, While the potatoes boil, make the dough. Add flour,oil and salt to a bowl. Pour half cup water and begin to mix to form a dough. Pour more water as needed and make a soft yet non-sticky dough., \u25a2, Knead it well until soft & pliable. If you press down the dough with your finger, it should dent easily meaning it is soft enough. Cover and rest until the filling is ready., \u25a2, When the potatoes are done, cool them slightly and peel while still warm. Ensure your boiled potatoes are not mushy or soggy., \u25a2, Grate or mash them well until no bits of potatoes remain. Using your fingers break any chunks of potatoes left in the mash otherwise they will tear the parathas. Also do not over mash it as the potatoes will turn pasty and sticky., \u25a2, Add ginger, green chilies, coriander leaves, salt, red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder, kasuri methi and chaat masala. Crush the kasuri methi before adding., \u25a2, Optional, \u2013 Dust off the excess & roll it to a 4 inch disc or roti. Place a portion of aloo stuffing in the center. Gently bring the sides of the roti up shaping like a cup. Repeat the steps of pushing the stuffing inside with your finger and bringing the dough up until the edges come over the stuffing. (Refer video)., \u25a2, If the stuffing is sticky, dip your fingers in flour. Bring the edges together over the stuffing and join them to seal carefully. (Refer step-by-step photo or video)., \u25a2, \u2013 Roll a 5 inch roti and place the stuffing in the center, hold the edges and make small pleats. Bring all of them on top and join them together to seal the stuffing. Remove the excess dough on top., \u25a2, Dip the stuffed ball in flour and flatten it gently to spread the stuffing evenly. This ensures the stuffing does not come out at all. Dust off the excess., \u25a2, Sprinkle some flour on the rolling area ., \u25a2, Place the paratha disc on the rolling area with the sealed side down. Begin to roll evenly all over without putting pressure., \u25a2, Do not roll the aloo paratha continuously. Instead rotate in clock-wise direction a little after every 4 to 6 rolls to ensure it does not tear or get stuck. Sprinkle flour as needed and avoid using excess. If you see the stuffing coming out, gently apply some flour to seal it., \u25a2, Roll the aloo paratha as thin or thick you like without tearing them. I roll mine to 8 to 9 inches., \u25a2, Transfer the rolled ones to a dry area. Once you are done with 3 you can begin to fry them., \u25a2, you will be able to make only 6 large parathas. So divide the dough to 12 and stuffing to 6 parts. Roll 2 rotis of 6 inches each. Spread the aloo mixture on one of the roti. Wet the edges with little water. Place the other roti on top of it. Press down gently on the sides to seal both the rotis. Then sprinkle flour and roll it evenly as thin as you want., Frying, \u25a2, Heat a pan or griddle to cook the aloo parathas. The griddle should be hot enough otherwise the parathas will turn hard,, \u25a2, When the pan is hot, gently transfer a rolled aloo paratha to it., \u25a2, With in 2 to 3 mins, you will see bubbles over it. Then flip it to the other side and cook., \u25a2, You will see the aloo paratha puffs and cooks well. Drizzle ghee or oil all over and flip it to the other side and cook., \u25a2, Smear some ghee on this side as well and press down the edges to cook thoroughly., \u25a2, Soon you will see golden to light brown spots on the aloo parathas. Remove to a plate and stack them. This keeps them soft., \u25a2, Top aloo paratha with some butter and serve with pickle or yogurt. This, coriander chutney, or, mint chutney, also go well., , , Notes, , Adjust the amount of spices and herbs to suit your liking., , Avoid using too much flour while rolling as it makes the parathas hard and dry., Roll the parathas evenly without putting pressure in one place., , For variation you can use store bought grated paneer or steamed carrots and peas. Ensure you mash the veggies very well., , You can also saute little methi leaves or spinach leaves until they wilt. Cool and add them to the mashed potato mixture. Also use only the leaves and not stalks of these greens., , Avoid using new potatoes. Old potatoes are best for this recipe. Boil potatoes just until fork tender and don\u2019t overcook. We don\u2019t want soggy potatoes soaked up in excess moisture., , Grate or mash potatoes well until you see no bits of potatoes in them. But do not over mash to the extent they become pasty and sticky., , After sealing aloo in the dough, do not forget to flatten and spread the stuffing. This way the stuffing is well distributed and won\u2019t come out while rolling., , Do not fry parathas on a low heat. Fry them on a moderately high flame. Keep adjusting the flame while you fry them so you don\u2019t burn the aloo parathas., , , , Video, Watch Aloo Paratha Video, , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Aloo Paratha Recipe | Potato Stuffed Paratha, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 189, , Calories from Fat 90, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 10g, 15%, Saturated Fat 5g, 31%, Cholesterol, 19mg, 6%, Sodium, 239mg, 10%, Potassium, 131mg, 4%, Carbohydrates, 22g, 7%, Fiber 4g, 17%, Sugar 1g, 1%, Protein, 4g, 8%, , , Vitamin A, 29IU, 1%, Vitamin C, 4mg, 5%, Calcium, 18mg, 2%, Iron, 1mg, 6%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , , , 10.7K, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Meat Recipes, , Butter Chicken Recipe (Indian Chicken Makhani), Chicken Korma Recipe, Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Biryani Recipe, Chicken Curry Recipe, , , , , About Swasthi, , I\u2019m Swasthi Shreekanth, the recipe developer, food photographer & food writer behind Swasthi\u2019s Recipes.

        "Aloo Methi Paratha": "Ingredients: , Potatoes, : Choosing the right kind of potatoes to make these parathas is very important. Some kind of potatoes turn too mushy and sticky after boiling. Avoid using such potatoes. Avoid using newly harvested potatoes. Old potatoes, Yukon Gold & Russet are suitable for parathas., , Spices, : Most people make aloo paratha with minimal spices like cumin, coriander powder and red chilli powder. The combination of spices I have used here makes the parathas so flavorful that your home will be filled with a delicate aroma while frying., , However if you do not have or don\u2019t prefer any particular spice, then you can simply skip it. You can also increase or decrease the spices to suit your taste., , Ghee, : Aloo parathas are pan fried mostly with a generous amount of ghee as it imparts that smoky aroma and flaky texture. If you do not eat ghee then use any regular oil., , Variations, , 1.You can also temper the spices before adding to the mashed potatoes. To do this, heat 1 tbsp oil or ghee in a small pan. Add ginger and green chilies. Saute for 30 seconds and then add all the spice powders and salt. Turn off and add this to the mashed potatoes., , Even without the tempering the aloo parathas will be great as the stuffing gets steam cooked while frying., , 2. Some people also add onions to the stuffing. They are added raw or sauteed in oil until they lose the raw smell., , , Related Recipes, , Gobi Paratha Reci..., , , Chapati Recipe (I..., , , Paratha Recipe, , , Palak Paratha (Sp..., , , Methi Paratha Rec..., , , Paneer Paratha Re..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Aloo Paratha Recipe | Potato Stuffed Paratha, , , 5, from, 203, votes, , , , These stuffed parathas are made with spiced potato filling.

Also divide the dough to 8 parts. Keep the dough covered., How to Make Aloo Paratha, \u25a2, Roll a dough ball in your palms to smooth. Lightly sprinkle some flour on the rolling area. Flatten the dough ball and dip it in some flour., \u25a2 Instructions: , I have shared 3 ways to roll the parathas (pics below). Take a look first to see which one looks easier to you., , 8. Sprinkle little flour on the rolling area. Smoothen a dough ball and dip it in flour. Flatten it and roll to a 4 inch round roti/disc., , , , 9. Place a spiced potato ball in the center and bring the sides up., , , , 10. Press down the stuffing to the center and bring the sides higher giving it a cup shape. If the aloo stuffing is sticky, then smear your fingers generously with some flour., , , , 11. Bring the sides higher by simply rotating the whole thing on your hand in clock-wise direction. The dough gets stretched by itself and comes over the stuffing. (check video), , , , 12. Repeat this step of pushing the aloo inside and bringing the sides higher by rotating until the edges come over to the top., , , , 13. Join all the edges well to ensure no filling is visible. I do not remove any excess dough, instead press it down back to the ball., , , , 14. Dip this ball in flour on both the sides and gently flatten it with your fingers. This is very important so the filling is evenly spread all over the paratha., , , , 15. Place the sealed side down on the rolling area and gently roll it evenly without putting pressure. Do not roll the aloo paratha continuously. Instead rotate in clock-wise direction a little after every 4 to 6 rolls to ensure it does not tear or get stuck., , You can make as thin or thick you like. I make mine thin and about 8 to 9 inches. If you see the filling coming out while rolling, then apply some flour there. Sprinkle flour only as needed and avoid using excess., , , , , I had shot these pictures in 2015 but never got to share it on the blog. The stuffing I made here is by tempering the spices in oil first and then I added it to the mashed potatoes. It is on the hotter side with more chilli powder., , Place the aloo stuffing in a 5 inch roti. Then make pleats and bring all the edges on top. Gently join them and pinch off the excess dough. Flatten slightly and dip in flour. Flatten it again to a 4 inch disc with your fingers to spread the filling evenly. Then roll it to as big as you can., , , , , you will be able to make only 6 large parathas. So divide the dough to 12 and stuffing to 6 parts., , , , Fry Aloo Paratha, , 16. After you are done rolling 3 to 4 paranthas, heat a griddle on a medium high flame. When the pan is hot enough, dust off excess flour from the aloo paratha & gently transfer it to the griddle. Within 2 minutes, you will see bubbles. Turn it to the other side., , , , 17. Press down gently with a spatula. You will see the aloo paratha begins to puff. Drizzle some ghee or oil. I add about 1 teaspoon ghee., , , , 18. Turn it to & fro to the other side and drizzle more ghee. Cook pressing down on the edges with a spatula so they cook well. Well-cooked parathas will leave your entire house filled with a great aroma. When you see golden to light brown spots on the aloo paratha, remove to a plate., , , , 19. To fry the next one, ensure the pan is hot enough and not extremely hot. Keep regulating the flame to medium or low as needed so the parathas don\u2019t burn. Place a clean cloth in a container or arrange a cooling rack & Stack the parathas to keep them moist., , Serve Aloo Paratha with pickle or yogurt. You can also top your parathas with butter. We love them with this, Mint chutney, or Cilantro /, coriander chutney, ., , , , Pro Tips, , Firstly boiling potatoes, the right way is the key to make the best aloo parathas. Boil them just until fork tender, meaning they are just cooked and not overcooked. Soggy potatoes will make a sticky and very moist stuffing which is not good to make parathas., , Mashing or grating potatoes, properly is also very important. There should be no chunks of potatoes left in the mash as they will tear the parathas. Do not over mash to the extent they become pasty. So you can also grate them rather than mashing to avoid pasty texture., , Stuffing the parathas, , Flattening and spreading the stuffing, after sealing the spiced aloo in the dough is what makes the aloo paratha perfect. This avoids the parathas from tearing and spreads the filling evenly., , Lastly frying parathas, on a low heat will make them hard. Cook them on a moderately medium high heat so they cook well. Also regulating the flame as needed is very important so they don\u2019t burn., , , , Preparation, \u25a2, Boil potatoes just until fork tender without making them mushy. To pressure cook in traditional cooker, cook for 3 to 4 whistles depending on the size of potatoes. In instant pot I pressure cooked for 5 mins since I used medium sized potatoes., \u25a2, While the potatoes boil, make the dough. Add flour,oil and salt to a bowl. Pour half cup water and begin to mix to form a dough. Pour more water as needed and make a soft yet non-sticky dough., \u25a2, Knead it well until soft & pliable. If you press down the dough with your finger, it should dent easily meaning it is soft enough. Cover and rest until the filling is ready., \u25a2, When the potatoes are done, cool them slightly and peel while still warm. Ensure your boiled potatoes are not mushy or soggy., \u25a2, Grate or mash them well until no bits of potatoes remain. Using your fingers break any chunks of potatoes left in the mash otherwise they will tear the parathas. Also do not over mash it as the potatoes will turn pasty and sticky., \u25a2, Add ginger, green chilies, coriander leaves, salt, red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder, kasuri methi and chaat masala. Crush the kasuri methi before adding., \u25a2, Optional, \u2013 Dust off the excess & roll it to a 4 inch disc or roti. Place a portion of aloo stuffing in the center. Gently bring the sides of the roti up shaping like a cup. Repeat the steps of pushing the stuffing inside with your finger and bringing the dough up until the edges come over the stuffing. (Refer video)., \u25a2, If the stuffing is sticky, dip your fingers in flour. Bring the edges together over the stuffing and join them to seal carefully. (Refer step-by-step photo or video)., \u25a2, \u2013 Roll a 5 inch roti and place the stuffing in the center, hold the edges and make small pleats. Bring all of them on top and join them together to seal the stuffing. Remove the excess dough on top., \u25a2, Dip the stuffed ball in flour and flatten it gently to spread the stuffing evenly. This ensures the stuffing does not come out at all. Dust off the excess., \u25a2, Sprinkle some flour on the rolling area ., \u25a2, Place the paratha disc on the rolling area with the sealed side down. Begin to roll evenly all over without putting pressure., \u25a2, Do not roll the aloo paratha continuously. Instead rotate in clock-wise direction a little after every 4 to 6 rolls to ensure it does not tear or get stuck. Sprinkle flour as needed and avoid using excess. If you see the stuffing coming out, gently apply some flour to seal it., \u25a2, Roll the aloo paratha as thin or thick you like without tearing them. I roll mine to 8 to 9 inches., \u25a2, Transfer the rolled ones to a dry area. Once you are done with 3 you can begin to fry them., \u25a2, you will be able to make only 6 large parathas. So divide the dough to 12 and stuffing to 6 parts. Roll 2 rotis of 6 inches each. Spread the aloo mixture on one of the roti. Wet the edges with little water. Place the other roti on top of it. Press down gently on the sides to seal both the rotis. Then sprinkle flour and roll it evenly as thin as you want., Frying, \u25a2, Heat a pan or griddle to cook the aloo parathas. The griddle should be hot enough otherwise the parathas will turn hard,, \u25a2, When the pan is hot, gently transfer a rolled aloo paratha to it., \u25a2, With in 2 to 3 mins, you will see bubbles over it. Then flip it to the other side and cook., \u25a2, You will see the aloo paratha puffs and cooks well. Drizzle ghee or oil all over and flip it to the other side and cook., \u25a2, Smear some ghee on this side as well and press down the edges to cook thoroughly., \u25a2, Soon you will see golden to light brown spots on the aloo parathas. Remove to a plate and stack them. This keeps them soft., \u25a2, Top aloo paratha with some butter and serve with pickle or yogurt. This, coriander chutney, or, mint chutney, also go well., , , Notes, , Adjust the amount of spices and herbs to suit your liking., , Avoid using too much flour while rolling as it makes the parathas hard and dry., Roll the parathas evenly without putting pressure in one place., , For variation you can use store bought grated paneer or steamed carrots and peas. Ensure you mash the veggies very well., , You can also saute little methi leaves or spinach leaves until they wilt. Cool and add them to the mashed potato mixture. Also use only the leaves and not stalks of these greens., , Avoid using new potatoes. Old potatoes are best for this recipe. Boil potatoes just until fork tender and don\u2019t overcook. We don\u2019t want soggy potatoes soaked up in excess moisture., , Grate or mash potatoes well until you see no bits of potatoes in them. But do not over mash to the extent they become pasty and sticky., , After sealing aloo in the dough, do not forget to flatten and spread the stuffing. This way the stuffing is well distributed and won\u2019t come out while rolling., , Do not fry parathas on a low heat. Fry them on a moderately high flame. Keep adjusting the flame while you fry them so you don\u2019t burn the aloo parathas., , , , Video, Watch Aloo Paratha Video, , NUTRITION INFO (estimation only), , Nutrition Facts, , Aloo Paratha Recipe | Potato Stuffed Paratha, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 189, , Calories from Fat 90, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 10g, 15%, Saturated Fat 5g, 31%, Cholesterol, 19mg, 6%, Sodium, 239mg, 10%, Potassium, 131mg, 4%, Carbohydrates, 22g, 7%, Fiber 4g, 17%, Sugar 1g, 1%, Protein, 4g, 8%, , , Vitamin A, 29IU, 1%, Vitamin C, 4mg, 5%, Calcium, 18mg, 2%, Iron, 1mg, 6%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @SwasthisRecipes, or tag, #swasthisrecipes, !, , , \u00a9 Swasthi\u2019s Recipes, , , , 10.7K, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Meat Recipes, , Butter Chicken Recipe (Indian Chicken Makhani), Chicken Korma Recipe, Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Biryani Recipe, Chicken Curry Recipe, , , , , About Swasthi, , I\u2019m Swasthi Shreekanth, the recipe developer, food photographer & food writer behind Swasthi\u2019s Recipes.

recipe, throughout the western and northern part of india. more often, these parathas are served with curd, , carrot\u00a0pickle, and topped with butter. cheese stuffed aloo paratha is prepared very similarly to traditional aloo parathas. however, cheese is added to the stuffing to make it more delicious., , paratha\u2019s are usually my fall back option for, breakfast, for those busy mornings. i usually prepare the, roti, dough in bulk and keep it for 2-3 days in fridge. recently, i had prepared the, stuffed mushroom recipe, , for which i had prepared the aloo cheese stuffing. i have reused the same stuffing and but with a new recipe. i have to admit that aloo cheese paratha recipe was hit and tasted even better compared to aloo paratha recipe., , , , , , , paratha\u2019s are one of the popular, breakfast recipes, in, north india, . same recipe of paratha\u2019s can be tried with myriad options of stuffing. there are several paratha\u2019s variants like gobi, mooli, paneer, , laccha paratha, etc. most common one is aloo paratha and this recipe is adapted version to it. cheese stuffing with aloo will enhance the taste of this simple paratha\u2019s. i have not deep fried this paratha\u2019s and i have pan fried it. i wouldn\u2019t recommend deep frying as the cheese may burst out while frying., , check my other, roti recipes, , especially, rumali roti, ,, garlic naan, ,,

if it is cold., , furthermore, i have added less oil, however you can add more oil or ghee while roasting to make it more tasty. you can also add vegetable ghee or dalda while heating., , moreover, adjust the spices according to your taste. you may need to be careful while serving to kids with spicy paratha\u2019s., , do not over stuff the stuffing if you are beginner as it may be difficult to roll. you can also, mix stuffing to dough and than roll the paratha\u2019s., , lipsa das, has shared a beautiful tip to, make perfect paratha: \u201calways dry roast the paratha on tava first and once both sides are slightly white, then put oil and flip it around for both sides again. otherwise the atta won\u2019t be properly cooked and might taste raw. also, after pleating, make sure to remove the excess flour from top so that it does accumulate in the centre of paratha once u start rolling\u201d., , , , , , , , , Related Recipes, , , , , , , , , , breakfast recipes, , , Paneer Kulcha Recipe |

        "Aloo Roti": "Ingredients: , , , , 4, , how to make alu roti with step by step photo:, , , , , 5, , notes:, , , , , , aloo roti recipe | potato roti recipe | how to make alu roti, with step by step photo and video recipe. there are myriad ways to make roti or indian flat breads making it a versatile staple for many indians. it is generally made with wheat or plain flour with or without extra flavour or ingredient infused to the dough. but this recipe is unique and the boiled potatoes are directly mixed to the wheat dough and thus making an healthy roti recipe., , i guess by now, many would have confused this recipe with the popular stuffed punjabi aloo paratha recipe. whenever you have aloo and flatbread together in one recipe, it fair to assume the alu paratha. but trust me this recipe is entirely different from it. there is a major difference between these 2 recipes. basically the main difference in these 2 recipe is, in this recipe i have mixed and infused the boiled and mashed potatoes within the dough. in other words the recipe is very similar to thepla or masala roti where the spiced ingredient is mixed directly to wheat dough. whereas, in, aloo paratha, , the aloo stuffing is prepared separately and later stuffed within the wheat-based covering to roll it into a flatbread., , , while there isn\u2019t any complicated steps in this\u00a0aloo roti recipe, yet some tips and suggestions for perfect recipe. firstly, the recipe can be shaped to desired shape as per your preference. i have shaped it to basic circular shaped roti, but it can be made as triangular and even square-shaped roti. secondly, these roti\u2019s remain fresh for days and hence can be prepared as travel meal. moreover it does not require any fancy curry and can be eaten as it is. lastly, the same recipe can be extended by adding other boiled and mashed veggies to the wheat dough. for instance, you can add gobi, carrot, peas and even, broccoli, for extra flavour., , finally, i would like to highlight my other, roti or naan bread recipes collection, with this post of aloo roti recipe. it includes recipes like, , tandoori roti, , , rice roti, , , jowar bhakri, , , akki roti, , , sabakki roti, , , rumali roti, , , ragi roti, and, jolada rotti recipe, . in addition to visit my other related and popular recipes collection like,, , , top paneer recipes collection,
