Please read our, disclosure policy, ., , , This recipe post is sponsored by The USA Rice Federation. I was compensated for my time, however all opinions are my own., , Why You\u2019ll Love this Vegetarian Paella, , Paella is a dish I love to order while dining out with friends and family. Its humble origins and one-pot appeal have a way of bringing people together, regardless of how intimate the setting is. So with its crowd-pleasing appeal and unique simplicity, it begs the question:, Why not just cook it at home?, , This vegetable paella is chockfull of authentic flavor, so don\u2019t fret over the ingredient list. (You may even have a fair amount of them already in your refrigerator or pantry.), , And although it, comes together in under one hour, , the rich layers of flavor will make you believe it\u2019s far more involved., , So break out the red wine and let\u2019s bring the flavors of the Mediterranean into our home kitchen!, , , The beauty of paella is that it\u2019s a blank canvas for you to add any combination of vegetables you like. While many classic paella recipes include a mix of prawns, clams, and chorizo, this veggie version packs enough smoky depth and texture to satisfy any omnivore., , I do, however, suggest trying to make the most of what\u2019s in season. By choosing local, seasonal veggies, you\u2019ll get the best flavor plus peak nutrition, which is a, double-win, . Therefore, the below recommendations are simply an outline for you to interchange as you see fit., , , Aromatics, . A key attribute of paella, aromatics are what build the foundation of flavor, lending aroma and dimension. I suggest using yellow onion and garlic, at minimum. Other optional add-ins include chopped carrots and celery., , Fresh veggies, . I love a mix of mushrooms, green beans, and bell peppers for vegetarian paella. If making during summer months, feel free to add chopped zucchini or yellow squash, too., , Frozen veggies, . Green peas are a staple in paella, however they\u2019re only in season during spring months. For this reason, I lean on frozen green peas to add a pop of vegetal sweetness., , Canned tomatoes, . I prefer fire-roasted tomatoes, which add a smoky backbone to the dish. You can also use plain diced tomatoes, or diced tomatoes with basil., , Spices, . The quintessential spice is paella is saffron, which grows primarily in Iran, Greece, Morocco, and India. Although pricey, a little saffron goes a LONG away because of how intrinsically fragrant it is. You can find saffron at most specialty grocery stores like, Whole Foods, , which is where I typically purchase it. However, if you\u2019d rather not purchase one extra spice, feel free to use ground turmeric instead., , Fresh herbs, . Classic herbs include flat-leaf parsley and scallions, which are fantastic compliments to the spices., , , , How to Make Vegetarian Paella, , The process of making paella is pretty seamless, yet the rewards are huge. To get ahead, you can slice and dice the veggies in advance, and thaw the green peas. From there, this whole dish comes together in under one hour, making it a total weeknight win., , , Start by heating a good glug of olive oil in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet or, paella pan, over medium-high. Cook your aromatics, bell pepper, and mushrooms until soft. Next, add the garlic and spices and cook until fragrant., , Deglaze the pan with white wine and simmer until mostly reduced. (I typically use Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.), , Stir in the rice and cook until slightly translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the broth, tomatoes, chickpeas, and green peas, and bring the mixture to a low boil., , Next, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and cook the paella for about 25 minutes, until the rice is tender., , Lastly, prepare the parsley oil by mixing the parsley, lemon zest and juice, and olive oil. Once the vegetable paella is cooked, scatter the parsley oil overtop and serve!, , , , , What is the Best Rice for Paella?, , Traditionally, paella may be made with Bomba rice, which is a short-grain, starchy white rice primarily cultivated in eastern Spain. Personally, however, I choose a U.S.-grown short-grain white rice due to its high quality and ability to find., , What is Short Grain Rice?, , U.S. short grain rice is softer and stickier than other varieties once cooked. It also has a slight springiness to the bite, making it a great choice for dishes like paella and risotto where rice is the key component. Some varieties include Arborio, Calmochi, and Koshihikari., , All U.S.-grown rice is gluten-free and the least allergenic of all grains. It\u2019s also rich in nutrients, contributing more than 15 vitamins and minerals, including folate and other B-vitamins, as well as iron. And because of rice\u2019s slow-digesting complex carbohydrates, it will help keep you satiated and well fueled., , Is Vegetable Paella Healthy?, , This dish is brimming with antioxidants, plant-based protein, and dietary fiber. In fact, one serving delivers almost 25% of your daily fiber goal. And while it\u2019s plenty satiating from the rice, chickpeas, and veggies, if you\u2019re craving an extra dose of protein, feel free to add meat or fish. For example, grilled shrimp, clams, or saut\u00e9ed chorizo., , Give this homemade paella recipe a try this week for a guaranteed family favorite.

Break up the saffron and add it to the broth. When it begins to simmer, give it, 1 minute, , and then lower the heat just to keep it warm., Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a, 12-inch Paella Pan, (, or something, similarly sized) over medium heat. Once heated, and the onions and peppers. Saut\u00e9 until softened and lightly browned, about, 3-5 minutes, ., Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for, 1 minute, ., Now add the tomatoes, smoked paprika, and sweet paprika. Saut\u00e9 for, 1-2 minutes, ., (if using dried thyme, add it with this step), Add the rice and remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Stir to coat well. Cook for, 1\u00a0minute, to lightly toast the rice and incorporate flavors. Move around occasionally to prevent sticking., Add the fresh thyme and slowly pour in broth. Add salt and pepper., Do not stir after this point, or, , it will release starches and cause creamier rice, ., Turn the heat to medium-high and bring the broth to a heavy simmer for, 1, -2 minutes, ., Now turn the heat down, (between medium-low and medium heat), to a mild simmer. You want to see movement in the pan while the broth is cooking down (, don't boil though, ). Simmer for, 15-20 minutes, until rice is al dente. Rotate the pan on the burner 1-2 times during cooking for even heat distribution., Once the broth is nearly\u00a0cooked off, you will need to pay close attention to the socarrat forming on the bottom of the pan (, the golden rice crust, ). You will start to hear a\u00a0snap, crackle, and pop, along with smelling a nutty aroma. This should take, 1-2 minutes, to form.\u00a0Stick a fork or spoon straight to the bottom to test if it's forming. (, If it smells like it's burning, remove from heat immediately, ) (, *see note, )., Remove the pan from the heat. Add the peas to the top of the rice (, don't mix in, ). Cover the pan with foil and let the paella rest for, 5-8 minutes, . Top with fresh-cut parsley, cracked pepper and side with lemon wedges to serve.\u00a0 Enjoy!, , , Notes, * Sometimes you might not get the\u00a0socarrat\u00a0to form and that's ok. It all depends on the pan, fat content, heat source and experience. The more you cook paella, the better you'll get at reading the signs. I've had times where I left it too long and it burned. That is never fun, so it's better to have no\u00a0socarrat than burnt\u00a0socarrat. Your paella will still be delicious without it., , *Saffron gives the paella its distinct flavor which is somewhat earthy and floral. It's very subtle\u00a0but\u00a0really finishes the dish. It also turns the rice to a beautiful golden color.\u00a0It's a little costly, so if it's not in your budget you can replace it with turmeric. It will have a different flavor, but will still be subtle and make the rice golden., , If you don't have a paella pan, I would recommend a large stainless steel pan (, don't use non-stick, )., , * Step-by-step photos above., , Nutrition, Calories:, 366, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 59, g, |, Protein:, 9, g, |, Fat:, 10, g, |, Saturated Fat:, 1, g, |, Sodium:, 528, mg, |, Potassium:, 450, mg, |, Fiber:, 4, g, |, Sugar:, 4, g, |, Vitamin A:, 1530, IU, |, Vitamin C:, 47.3, mg, |, Calcium:, 27, mg, |, Iron:, 3.8, mg, , , , Tried this recipe?, Follow me, @veganhuggs, and mention, #veganhuggs, !, , , , , , , , , , , , , Vegan Huggs Weekly Newsletter, , Receive the tastiest vegan recipes straight to your inbox!
