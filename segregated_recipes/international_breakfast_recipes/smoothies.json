We especially love, Strawberry Banana Smoothies, and, Pineapple Smoothies, ., , , Pin this recipe for later!, Pin This, , , Why We Love This Recipe, , , Healthy \u2013, Lots of fruit and veggies make this apple smoothie a healthy snack or breakfast., , Tastes great \u2013, This smoothie tastes sweet and refreshing \u2013 kids absolutely love it, and grown-ups, too!, , Quick and easy \u2013, It whips up fast, and uses simple, , , Liquid:, The liquid is a combination of apple juice and water. The apple juice imparts a sweet apple flavor throughout the smoothie., , Fruit:, This smoothie contains a combination of apples, frozen pineapple and frozen banana. You can use sweet or tart apples. I\u2019ve made it both ways and they\u2019re equally delicious., , Greens:, My favorite leafy green to add to smoothies is fresh baby spinach. The flavor is mild and does not come through at all. Spinach adds a beautiful shade of green and an extra boost of nutrients to this smoothie. You can also swap the spinach for another leafy green of your choice (like kale), just be aware that some greens have a strong flavor., , To make this smoothie:, ",
        "Chocolate peanut butter smoothie": "Ingredients: , It\u2019s honestly not too bad for you, with about 8.5-12.5g of protein per serving (depending if you split it into 2 or 3 servings) because its loaded with bananas, , peanut butter, , and, Greek yogurt, ., , , , creamy peanut butter \u2013 to add a nice peanut butter flavor, , bananas \u2013 frozen is best if you have them, , milk \u2013 to help everything blend up, you can use cow milk, or other non-dairy milks like almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk, etc., , vanilla greek yogurt \u2013 an unflavored Greek yogurt won\u2019t be very sweet, so I recommend something with a little sugar or sugar substitute, , cocoa powder \u2013 unsweetened cocoa powder to give it a nice chocolatey taste, , ice cubes \u2013 depending how thick you want your smoothie, , , How to make Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie?, , To make this smoothie you\u2019ll need a, blender, , I have a, Blendtec, , but any blender should work! Add your, creamy peanut butter, , bananas, milk, , yogurt, , , cocoa powder, and ice into the blender., , Blend it all up until the smoothie is mixed well, and nice and creamy., , Top your glasses with warmed peanut butter, banana slices, and chocolate syrup, if desired., , Tips and Tricks:, , , I suggest using a frozen banana if you have them. I like to take any of my bananas that are starting to get too ripe to just eat, this means they\u2019re a little spotty and overripe, but not soft yet. Peel the bananas and cut them in half and toss them into freezer. Now they\u2019re ready to use whenever you need frozen bananas for smoothies. Frozen bananas help to add thickness to your smoothie, without losing the flavor. Too much ice and your smoothie will be watered down., , You can use any, vanilla yogurt, that you like., , Plain yogurt, will not have any sugar so you may want to add some sugar, or some honey, or maple syrup, to your smoothie if it\u2019s not sweet enough for you this way. I like using, vanilla greek yogurt, because it\u2019s usually lower in added sugar than other yogurts, but has a lot of protein. Plus I think it\u2019s so delicious \ud83d\ude09, , Try adding a scoop, or half a scoop of vanilla or chocolate protein powder to make this smoothie even more filling, and protein packed., , , , Smoothie Bowl Toppings:, , This creamy chocolate peanut butter banana smoothie is so delicious! It\u2019s one of my favorite smoothies to drink, and it would also be delicious as a smoothie bowl! If you want to make this smoothie into a bowl, some yummy topping ideas for your smoothie bowl are:, , , Sliced Bananas, , Granola, , Chia Seeds, , Sliced Strawberries, , Drizzled, Peanut Butter, or Cashew Butter, , Shredded or Shaved Coconut, , Chocolate Shavings, or Nibs, , Hemp Seeds, , Cacao Nibs, , , Frequently Asked Questions:, , Are Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana smoothies healthy?, , This smoothie is a good healthier option for breakfast, or a snack. The smoothie is loaded with fiber, potassium, protein, and other vitamins that are good for our bodies. It\u2019s not a low calorie breakfast or drink, but is filling, so it\u2019s a good option to have occasionally, but not every day., , How to freeze bananas?, , Peel the bananas and cut them into halves, then flash freeze them by placing them on a lined baking sheet and putting it in the freezer until frozen solid. Then transfer the bananas to a freezer safe air tight container, or freezer safe bag for up to 5 or 6 months., , This is a great healthy smoothie, and is a great way to start the new year off right, especially if you\u2019re like me and pretty much addicted to candy and cookies after all the Christmas goodies. This is a delicious breakfast option, or a healthier alternative that will still completely satisfy your sweet tooth., , Looking for more smoothie recipes?, , , Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie, , Green Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie, , Tropical Green Smoothie, , Blueberry Smoothie, , Peach Smoothie, , , Connect w, ith Like Mother, Like Daughter, , Be sure to follow us on social media, so you never miss a single post!, , Facebook, |, Instagram, |, Pinterest, |, Email, , , , , , , , , , , Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie, , , Created By:, Aimee, , , Servings, 2, , , , Course, Drinks, , Cuisine, American, , , Chocolate peanut butter banana smoothie is the perfect creamy smoothie for a sweet breakfast or lighter dessert!, , , , , , Prep Time, 5, minutes, , mins, , Total Time, 5, minutes, , mins, , , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , Share Recipe, , , , , , 1x, 2x, 3x, \u25a2, 1/4, , cup, , creamy peanut butter, \u25a2, 2, , bananas, , (frozen is best if you have it), \u25a2, 1/2, , cup, , milk, , (add another 1/4 cup if you have a lower powered blender), \u25a2, 1/2, , cup, , low fat vanilla greek yogurt, \u25a2, 2, , TBS, , cocoa powder, \u25a2, 3/4, , cup, , ice, , Blend on high until smooth., Pour into glasses and serve., , Video, , , , Nutrition, Calories:, 368, kcal, Carbohydrates:, 46, g, Protein:, 17, g, Fat:, 20, g, Saturated Fat:, 5, g, Polyunsaturated Fat:, 4, g, Monounsaturated Fat:, 9, g, Cholesterol:, 11, mg, Sodium:, 185, mg, Potassium:, 772, mg, Fiber:, 7, g, Sugar:, 25, g, Vitamin A:, 212, IU, Vitamin C:, 10, mg, Calcium:, 163, mg, Iron:, 2, mg, , , , , , , Made this recipe?, Tag me and share!

        "Carrot Cake Smoothie": "Ingredients: resulting in\u00a0a thick, smooth, just like, carrot cake., , , , Carrot, - Obviously!, Walnut halves, - Preferably soaked overnight so they're easier to blend and digest. These are a classic carrot cake ingredient and what's more is that they give a wonderful creamy, thick texture to the smoothie., Spices, - I use ground cinnamon and ground mixed spice. If you're outside of the UK, pumpkin pie spice works in place of mixed spice., Dates, - For natural sweetness. I recommend Mejool but any dates are fine., Unsweetened dairy-free milk, - Almond or coconut milk are great choices., Vanilla extract, - Really helps give it that \"cake\" flavour!, , , , More Banana-free Vegan Smoothies, , Blueberry Muffin Smoothie, , Pineapple Matcha Smoothie, , Hormone-Balancing Smoothie with Almond, Maca & Cinnamon, , , , , , , Continue to Content, , , , \ud83d\udcd6 Recipe, , , , , Carrot Cake Smoothie (No Banana), , , , Yield:, , 2, , , , Prep Time:, , 5 minutes, , , , , Total Time:, , 5 minutes, , , , , , A healthy, delicious carrot cake-inspired smoothie.

Carrot cake is my husband's favorite dessert, and we love smoothies - so this was a big hit!  I doubled the recipe for two servings, used more than 8 walnut halves and about six dates per serving, more than a cup of almond milk per serving, used 1/2 t. nutmeg and 1/2 t. cloves in addition to the t. cinnamon, and instead of ice I used frozen zucchini.

I'm exactly the same when it comes to nanas and I have real trouble finding recipes without them so thank you! :) I'm bed bound and need carers while Mum's at work so she makes me a smoothie every morning and puts it in the fridge for the carers to give me at lunch, we've been looking for new recipes for her to try (she's usually just a shove it all in woman) so she'll want to give this a go!

Bless her. It's so lovely of you to ask! Anything high in protein would be much appreciated and if you could make it sweet then even better, major sweet tooth in this house :D keep doing what you're doing, I love your blog and you seem lovely <3, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Aimee, , says, , , January 11, 2016 at 2:43 pm, , , , thank you lovely! I will keep that in mind for my future recipes then :-) I too was once bedbound for a long stretch and it was near impossible to eat healthy. My mum's a good cook but like yours, was not familiar with \"healthier\" cooking (which is really what you need when you're unwell) so it was frustrating not being able to make things for myself! anyway, keep well and keep an eye out for sugar-free sweet things coming soon x, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Primary Sidebar, , , , I'm Aimee, , the author behind the Wallflower Kitchen blog and 'Great British Vegan' cookbook, , More about me \u2192, , , Trending recipes, , Baked Bubble & Squeak Cakes, Creamy Vegan Mushroom Risotto, Easy Vegan French Toast, Footer, , \u2191 back to top, , , , About, , , Privacy Policy, , About, , , , , Contact, , , Contact me, , , , Pinterest, , RSS Feed, , YouTube, , , , , As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

        "Pear Ginger Smoothie": "Ingredients: but I really wanted something different this time. Usually it\u2019s all about frozen bananas and berries, but that gets old after a while, plus it\u2019s more summery and Colorado is so far from those warm summer months I don\u2019t even want to think about it. Case and point, it was 8 degrees out on my long run Saturday morning., , It turns out if you dice up a couple of pears and freeze them, they make an excellent addition, not to mention one that\u2019s full of fiber to this green smoothie.\u00a0The fresh grated ginger is perfect if your stomach is all sorts of angry with you from the not so healthy foods you\u2019ve been indulging in. Not only does that freshness give you a cleansing feeling, but it can also help soothe that bloated, grumbling, upset stomach. To give the smoothie a healthy dose of protein to keep me full until lunch, I added Greek yogurt and almond butter, works like a charm every time.

Plus you'll get new recipes from me every week!, , , Save Recipe, \u0394, Email, SAVE!, , , By submitting this form, you consent to receive emails from Happy Healthy Mama., , , Let\u2019s face it. \u00a0Some of the healthiest foods on the planet can cause some serious bloat. \u00a0I\u2019m looking at you, broccoli. \u00a0Sorry lentils, I love you, but you aren\u2019t doing my stomach any favors., , Now, I would never cut those healthy foods out of my diet just because they cause me to get bloated. \u00a0I just am careful not to eat them before I\u2019m going out on a date night with my hubby. \u00a0Or any time I want to wear something that isn\u2019t loose., , The good news is, just as there are foods that can cause bloating, there are also some foods that can fight the bloat. \u00a0I stuffed a whole bunch of anti-bloating foods into a smoothie. \u00a0Why? \u00a0For those times when you need something to eat, but, really, don\u2019t want a bloated stomach., , Saturday night Tim and I had a date night planned. \u00a0Our dinner reservations were for 8 o-clock, which is a super late dinner for us. \u00a0I knew my noon lunch wouldn\u2019t be enough to sustain me until dinner time, so I made this Anti-Bloat Smoothie. \u00a0It was filling enough to tide me over until dinner, and kept my stomach from getting the food baby look., , What\u2019s in the Anti-Bloat Smoothie and how does it work?, , Cucumbers, : \u00a0They are loaded with water, which helps fight bloating., , Banana, : \u00a0Bananas are high in potassium. \u00a0Potassium helps regulate sodium levels, which prevents water retention. \u00a0Too much sodium is a big cause of bloating, so that\u2019s why bananas (and other foods high in potassium) help with bloating., , Coconut Water, : \u00a0Like bananas, coconut water is high in potassium., , Ginger:, Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory food as well as a digestive aid. \u00a0It soothes the digestive system and relaxes the muscles of the digestive tract, which keeps you from getting bloated. \u00a0You know I love my ginger. \u00a0Take a look at that huge hunk of fresh ginger in the picture below. \u00a0I eat one of those per week., , Apple Cider Vinegar, : \u00a0I list this one as optional in the smoothie recipe because the smoothie absolutely tastes better without it. \u00a0Apple cider vinegar, however, is a rock star for reducing gas and bloating. \u00a0So if you are super serious about reducing your bloat, add this to your smoothie., , The taste of this anti-bloating smoothie is fresh. \u00a0I love the cucumber and ginger together, and the banana sweetens it up just enough. \u00a0The coconut water flavor is subtle, not overpowering. \u00a0I really don\u2019t love coconut water on its own, but do love it in my smoothies. \u00a0It\u2019s filled with electrolytes, so it\u2019s a great naturally hydrating beverage choice. \u00a0If you choose to add the, apple cider vinegar, it muddles the flavor a bit, but is still good., , May your days be bloat-free, friends!, , I love how smooth and creamy my, Vitamix blender, makes this Anti-Bloat Smoothie!, , How to Make the Anti-Bloat Smoothie, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Print, , clock, , clock icon, cutlery, , cutlery icon, flag, , flag icon, folder, , folder icon, instagram, , instagram icon, pinterest, , pinterest icon, facebook, , facebook icon, print, , print icon, squares, , squares icon, heart, , heart icon, heart solid, , heart solid icon, , , , , , The Anti-Bloat Smoothie, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 5 Stars, , , , , , , , , 4 Stars, , , , , , , , , 3 Stars, , , , , , , , , 2 Stars, , , , , , , , , 1 Star, , , , 4.8, from, 11, reviews, , , , , Author:, , Happy Healthy Mama, , , , Total Time:, , 5 mins, , , , Yield:, , 1, , 1, x, , , , , , , , , , Print Recipe, , , , , Print Recipe, , , , , Description, , , This Anti-Bloat Smoothie fights bloating and tastes delicious!, , , , , , , , , , Copy to clipboard, , Copy to clipboard, , , , , , , , Scale, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , , , 1/2 cup, coconut water, , 1, banana, , 1, large cucumber, sliced, , 1, inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and sliced, , handful of ice, , , , , , , , , , , , Cook Mode, , Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , , , , , , , Hardcore Version: Add 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar to the mix., , , , , , , Prep Time:, , 5 mins, Cook Time:, , 0 minutes, Category:, , smoothie, Cuisine:, , American, , , , , Nutrition, , , Serving Size:, , 1, , Calories:, , 180, , Sugar:, , 9g, , Sodium:, , 31mg, , Fat:, , 0g, , Carbohydrates:, , 43g, , Protein:, , 2g, , , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, , Tag, @happyhealthymama, on Instagram and hashtag it, #happyhealthymama, , , , , , , , Smoothies are a great way to get ultimate nutrition into your diet quickly!

I make little adjustments like adding Greek yogurt sometimes or a half a frozen banana to make it extra cold.

        "Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Smoothie": "Ingredients: This post is sponsored by Quaker Oats but all opinions are 100% my own. As always, thank you for supporting brands that support What The Fork Food Blog, \u2665, Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Smoothies, You guys totally love your oatmeal smoothies. My, Strawberry Banana Oatmeal Smoothies, were my fourth most popular recipe on the blog in 2015 and my, Peanut Butter Banana Oatmeal Smoothies, just missed the list of, Top 10 Recipes from 2015, ., I\u2019m sure these Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Smoothies will be just as popular. Because really, who could resist a little chocolate peanut butter combination in the morning? Especially when it\u2019s for something that\u2019s not going to cause you to cheat on your 2016 healthier eating goals. You\u2019re more than welcome \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f, I\u2019m a really big fan of oatmeal smoothies in the morning. The oatmeal really makes the smoothies filling so they truly keep you satisfied until lunch. I often find that if I have a regular smoothie for breakfast, I\u2019m hungry shortly after., That\u2019s not the case with these chocolate peanut butter oatmeal smoothies. They consist of 1% milk, oats, and peanut butter, to help keep you fueled, and are sweetened with just enough honey., I used, Quake, r, Gluten Free Oats for this smoothie and they worked out really, really well. I actually prefer these quick oats in smoothies over the old fashioned oats that I had previously been using., Quaker Gluten Free oats are rolling out and will be readily available nationwide this month. With nearly 140 years of oat expertise and as leaders in oat milling, Quaker has confidently been able to provide gluten free oats to those who need them.

The smoothie thickens up as it sits (due to the oatmeal). You could try it and let me know how it works out for you.

I think I used less than 1/8 tsp, but a full 1/8 tsp (or maybe even a bit more) would probably be fine., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Erin, , , February 8, 2017 at 11:09 am, , , , Can the mint extract be replaced with peppermint oil?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Amanda @ .running with spoons., , , February 10, 2017 at 11:47 am, , , , You should be able to, Erin.

        "Pumpkin Apple Smoothie": "Ingredients: making it the perfect breakfast for yourself and your kids. My three absolutely love this pumpkin smoothie, and I can blend it up in less than 5 minutes \u2013 a must for busy school mornings., , Canned pumpkin gives the smoothie its lovely orange color, and I added a whole apple, skin and all. If you look closely you can see the pretty red flecks of apple in the photos. Both the apple and some oats add lots of fiber. Greek yogurt provides filling protein for even more staying power., , , I love my Vitamix blender, for making smoothies, but don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have a Vitamix or other high-powered blender. When I first made this pumpkin smoothie I didn\u2019t, and my regular blender created a smooth consistency just the same, even with the apple in this smoothie. Try my other great smoothies, , Strawberry Banana Smoothie, and, Chocolate Protein Shake, ., , So I have a question for those of you reading who are also food bloggers. Do you ever get to the end of a photo shoot and realize that you totally forgot to add in something that you really wanted as a prop in your photo? When I first started taking the photos of this pumpkin smoothie I forgot to sprinkle the oats around the smoothie. I had even brought the container of oats into the living/dining room (where I take my photos) and set them next to me. I do things like this all.the.time and it is SO frustrating. I really should write down my plan for my photo set-ups and checking my list before I start, but I\u2019m always in a hurry and just want to get it done!, , Go ahead, try this Pumpkin Apple Breakfast Smoothie this week!

I believe this will help me shed those few pounds and lower my Triglycerides., , P.S. I read a comment about adding protein powder instead of pumpkin. I bodybuilt for five straight years in my 30\u2019s. Very close to competition form. I have read tons of books on the subject. Unless something has changed in the last 20 years, our kidneys can only process 30 mg of protein every three hours. Anything over that puts a lot of strain on our kidneys as they are overworked. I used to eat a can of tuna by itself every three hours.
