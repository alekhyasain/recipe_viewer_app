I had really thick bread and decided to use a little bit more than a cup of almond milk, maybe an extra 1/8 of a cup and used 2.5 eggs (1 egg was super small farm fresh).

OMG, it was so unbelievably good I actually found myself licking the plate. #help, , Tony and I love doing big breakfasts on the days we wake up really hungry. Think hashbrowns, eggs, bacon and now my, BEST ever french toast recipe, , that can easily be made either healthy or indulgent \u2014 your choice., , In a shallow bowl, add your eggs and slightly whisk them. Then add in your almond milk or coconut milk, brown sugar, vanilla extract, almond extract, and cinnamon., Add 1 tablespoon butter to a skillet and place over medium heat., While the butter melts, dunk a slice of bread gently in the egg mixture and then flip to make sure you coat both sides of the bread; do not leave bread in the mixture for too long. 10-15 seconds max., Place dunked slices on the hot skillet and cook until golden brown on each side. Repeat with more slices. You should be able to get at least 6 slices. Top with fruit of choice, nut butter, yogurt or a drizzle of maple syrup!, , , Recipe Notes, To make this orange french toast:, instead of 1 cup almond milk, you can use \u00bd cup orange juice and \u00bd cup almond milk., , If you want to make this french toast a little bit more healthy:, I suggest using a sprouted whole grain bread. Ezekiel, Silver Hills Bakery and Angelic are all great brands we love. You can also reduce the sugar in the recipe to 1/2 tablespoon!, , To freeze:, let the french toast cool completely, then transfer individual slices to freezer-friendly bags. If you're putting multiple slices into one bag, wrap each slice in plastic wrap or place wax paper in between the slices. The healthy french toast will stay good in the freezer for up to 2 months!, , To reheat from frozen:, simply stick frozen french toast slices in the toaster or heat them up in the oven for 5-10 minutes until heated through., , , Nutrition, Serving:, 2, slices, Calories:, 324, cal, Carbohydrates:, 49.8, g, Protein:, 14.4, g, Fat:, 9.5, g, Saturated Fat:, 3.1, g, Fiber:, 6.9, g, Sugar:, 13.5, g, , , , Recipe by: Monique Volz // Ambitious Kitchen | Photography by:, Eat Love Eats, , , , , , , , , , , , , Shop This Post, , , , , , Turn on your JavaScript to view content, , , , , , , , , , The, Ambitious Kitchen, Cookbook, , , Order Now, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Hi, I\u2019m Monique, , , , , I\u2019m so happy you're here.

We\u2019ve made it twice over the Christmas break since you posted it. The almond extract abs vanilla almond milk are the perfect addition!! The first time I made it I used challah from our local bakery. Today I used our standard thick multigrain sandwich bread.

I\u2019ve never had orange zest in french toast but it makes them 100% more tasty and flavorful! I didn\u2019t have any brown sugar or coconut sugar so I just substituted in natural maple syrup instead and it was still delicious! Definitely will make this french toast recipe again!!!

Sometimes I also use leftover condensed from another recipe and mix some cocoa powder to make an extremely delicious spread., , Nuts & nut butters, add some protein and nutty flavor to the sandwiches. You can use walnuts, pistachios, roasted and skinned peanuts, almonds and cashews. Peanut butter and almond butter also go well. The recipe works with almond meal as well., , Cream cheese, : Bring the cream cheese to room temperature. Whisk it well with a fork. Use it moderately as cream cheese is salted. I have not tried the cream cheese and nut combo., , , Related Recipes, , 35 Sandwich Recip..., , , Mushroom Sandwich..., , , Veg Sandwich Reci..., , , Potato Sandwich R..., , , Paneer Sandwich R..., , , How to Make Ice C..., , , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Chocolate Sandwich, , , 5, from, 14, votes, , , , This Chocolate sandwich makes for a quick dessert snack.

Layer the chopped nuts all over the chocolate or spread peanut butter over the other slice., \u25a2, If you prefer sprinkle some ground cinnamon and place the sliced banana (or maple syrup if required)., \u25a2, Cover the chocolate filled bread with the other slice of bread. Spread \u00bd tablespoon butter over the chocolate sandwich, Toasting Chocolate Sandwich on stovetop in a pan, \u25a2, Melt \u00bd tablespoon butter in the pan., \u25a2, Place the sandwich gently in the hot pan, with the buttered side up. Let toast on a low heat until the bread turns crisp. Gently turn it to the other side with a spatula., \u25a2, Immediately sprinkle chocolate chips on top of the hot toasted chocolate sandwich. The chocolate begins to melt, spread it with a butter knife or a spoon., \u25a2, Remove to a rack once the sandwich is crisp at the bottom.

Cover and toast them until golden and crisp., In the Air fryer, \u25a2, You can also place the prepared sandwich (buttered on both the sides) in the air fryer. Air fry for 5 mins at 350 F or 180 C. Do not air fry for too long the chocolate can burn on the sides and the bread turns too hard., , , Notes, , I prefer to go heavy on the nuts \u2013 about 8 walnuts, 10 almonds or cashews per sandwich. So I use maple syrup to make them a bit more sweeter. You may skip the sweetener and simply use banana., , If using cream cheese, bring it to room temperature to soften. Whisk it well with a fork until smooth.
