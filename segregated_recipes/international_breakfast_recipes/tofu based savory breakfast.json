Mix., , Create a well in the center of the bowl and pour in the warm water., , Use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix the flour and water. Once the dough starts to come together, add in 1 tsp of oil., , Use your hands to mix the bits of dough. You can also use a stand mixer if you have one. Knead together for several minutes. If the dough is a bit dry, add a splash of water., , Keep kneading until you have a smooth ball of dough., , Shape the dough into a ball, then place it in a bowl., , Cover it with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes., , Filling, Drain excess liquid from your tofu. I like to do this by wrapping the tofu in a towel and pressing down with a heavy surface. Mash the tofu afterwards then set aside., Heat a pan. Add in 2 tbsp sesame or other oil. When the oil is hot, add in the scallions, bell peppers, and carrots. Season with some salt, sesame seeds, and chinese 5 spice (optional). Cook over medium high heat for 4-5 minutes until the carrots are tender. Add in a bit more sesame oil. Adjust seasoning based on desired taste., , In the same pan, add in the tofu. Mix in turmeric and black salt or other salt. Mix until well incorporated and tofu is yellow. Leave to cook for a few minutes until excess water from the tofu has evaporated. Turn off heat and then mix the tofu and carrot mix together., Leave filling to cool while you prepare the wrappers., , Making the wrappers, You can watch the video below to see a complete step-by-step on how to make the wrappers., Add some flour on your work surface. Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it  a few times., Punch hole in the middle of the dough and then create a donut shape. Slowly stretch., , Slice the dough into 8 pieces. Roll or shape each piece of dough into a ball. Cover the dough with a towel to prevent from drying while you work on one at a time., , To make a wrapper, press down on the ball of dough and lightly flatten it over the surface. Sprinkle a little flour on top and lightly coat your rolling pin with some flour as well., While holding both ends of the rolling pin, roll out the dough by moving the pin forward and backward. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and repeat the movement., Continue to roll out the dough until you have a wrapper that\u2019s around 5-5 \u00bd inches in diameter. If you can\u2019t make them into a perfectly round shape, that\u2019s okay! Mine weren\u2019t perfect but I was still able to properly fold these together. It really takes some time and practice to get a hang of making wrappers., , Place the rolled out wrappers on a tray and cover with a dry towel to prevent them from drying out. Roll out the rest of the dough., Take a rolled out piece of wrapper and place around 1/3-1/2  cup of filling into the center., , Crease the edges and pinch with your fingers. Twist to seal and then carefully press it down to flatten. See video for a visual guide. Afterwards, place back the pancake on the tray and cover with a dry towel to prevent it from drying out. Repeat for the rest of the wrappers., , Cooking the pancakes, Heat a pan (with a lid), add in 1 tbsp of oil (for every 2 pancakes). When hot, add in the pancakes and lightly press down. Leave to cook over medium heat for 4-5 minutes until it has a golden brown crust. Flip over and leave to cook for another 4-5 until golden brown., , Prepare the lid of your pan. Using the lid as protection, carefully pour 2 tbsp of water (1 tbsp for each pancake) into the pan and then immediately cover to prevent it from splashing due to the heat., Leave to cook in the steam, until the water has evaporated, around 5-6 minutes. Take out the pies and repeat this step for the remaining ones. Enjoy while hot! See storage tips in the notes below., , , WATCH Video, , Notes, Refrigerator:, , Place the cooked pancakes in an air-tight container and refrigerate for up to 5 days. To reheat, you can pan fry them again with a splash of water or oven-toast in low heat., , Freezer:, You can freeze the cooked pancakes for months (longest I\u2019ve done is 2) and then just reheat from frozen by pan-frying.

        "Vegan Spinach Quiche": "Ingredients: , , , Easy Homemade Pie Crust Recipe, , I baked this quiche in a simple homemade pie crust which is very easy to make and prepared in only 5 minutes. All you have to do is whisk together the flour and salt. Then add cubed vegan butter, and optionally, also a flax-egg, (or regular egg if you\u2019re not vegan). The flax-egg is not necessary, but I find the dough holds together better with it, especially when using gluten-free flour. After adding the vegan butter (and the flax-egg), knead with your hands until the dough starts to clump together. Then transfer to a working surface and continue kneading until a smooth dough forms. Flatten dough into a disc, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes., , , How to make Homemade Pie Crust, , After the chill time, roll out pie crust dough evenly on a floured surface, about 1/6-inch (4mm) thick. Then transfer into an 8- or 9-inch (20/22cm) lightly greased pie dish. Shape the edges in whatever shape you like or crimp the overhanging dough. Before adding the filling make sure to prick the bottom a few times with a fork. Now you can decide if you want to pre-bake your crust for a crispier result or just add the filling and bake both together. If you\u2019re like me, you will probably bake both together, haha!, , , , , , , , , , Healthy Vegan Quiche, , I prefer using fresh spinach in my quiche, though frozen spinach would be fine as well. Also, I love to add leek, scallions, and garlic, which gives my vegan quiche a little extra flavor but any kind of onions will do! And if you do not have fresh onions or garlic on hand, you can substitute onion powder and garlic powder., , , , , , How to make Spinach Quiche + Helpful Tipps, , The key to preventing a soggy quiche is to reduce the moisture in your vegetables. So please make sure to first saut\u00e9 the spinach until completely wilted (or thaw frozen spinach) and then drain and squeeze well to remove any excess liquid. When you wrap it in several layers of paper towel and squeeze it you\u2019ll be surprised at how much more water will come out of the spinach!, And if you want to add additional veggies, such as mushrooms, , , Creamy, Cheesy Eggless Quiche, , Once your spinach mixture is prepared and well squeezed, such as crumbled vegan feta or any shredded vegan cheese you like. Finally, add the creamy spinach filling into your prepared pie crust and bake as instructed in the recipe box below., , , , , , , , , , A note about the Baking Time, , All ovens are different in temperature so the total baking time could take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour. The baking time also depends on which pie dish you use or if you cover your vegan quiche during baking because a covered pie takes longer until done. I recommend checking every now and then.\u00a0As the center of your quiche is no longer liquid and lightly browned, you can remove it from the oven. It\u2019s totally okay if the filling is still a bit wobbly because it firms up as it cools. My cheesy spinach quiche took around 50 minutes, but I covered it after 25 minutes to keep the crust from burning., , , Toppings, , Finally, you can top the quiche with toasted pine nuts for an incredibly tasty nutty flavor, if you like. Another great idea is to serve your individual slices with creamy, guacamole, , dollops of, almond ricotta, , , cashew aioli, ,\u00a0or any other, dips, of your choice., , , This Cheesy Vegan Spinach Quiche is:, , , Vegan, Vegetarian, , Eggless, , Dairy-free, , Plant-based, , Can be made Gluten-free & Soy-free, , Savory, , Healthy, , Easy to make, , Totally delicious!, , Perfect for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner, , Also great for meal prep as it tastes cold too!, , Can be served crustless as a vegan omelet or vegan frittata, , , , , Vegan Spinach Quiche Serving Suggestions, , If you are serving your frittata as part of a bigger brunch, , vegan egg salad burritos, ,, vegan french toast, , , pancakes, , , cr\u00eapes, , , apple pie roll-ups, , , waffles, , , oatmeal, , , overnight oats, or a simple but delicious, banana bread, would all be great choices to go with it., , , More Spinach Recipes to try, , , Best Spinach & Garlic Mushroom Pizza, , Easy Mushroom Spinach Pasta, , Crispy Spinach Pockets, , Turkish Borek (Spinach Rolls), , Vegan Empanadas, , Ravioli Pockets (German Maultaschen), , Vegan Spinach Croquettes, , Spinach Wraps with Cashew Cheese, , , , If you try this Vegan Spinach Quiche or another of my recipes, feel free to leave a comment on how it goes.

Add in the leek or scallions, and saut\u00e9 for about 3 minutes until lightly browned and softened. Add the spinach, and continue cooking until wilted, about 2 minutes (, or simply thaw frozen spinach, )., Transfer into a colander and drain. Then wrap in paper towels and squeeze to remove any excess liquid., Tofu filling, Blend the tofu, chickpea flour, nutritional yeast, and seasonings until smooth and creamy., Add spinach mixture and mix to combine. Then, stir in crumbled vegan feta cheese. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. (, If the filling seems too thick, add a bit of non-dairy cream, or if it seems too watery, stir in a bit of flour, .), Fill the filling into the prepared crust, smoothing out evenly., Bake for 10 minutes to set pie crust, then turn the temperature down to 356\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and bake for further 30-40 minutes until filling is set and light golden brown on top.

Top with toasted pine nuts and serve with, dips, if you like., Enjoy! \ud83d\ude0a, , , Notes, , If you want to pre-bake your crust for a crispier result, top with dried beans or chickpeas to avoid collapsing, and blind bake for 15 minutes at 425\u00b0F.
