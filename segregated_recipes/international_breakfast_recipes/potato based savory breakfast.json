        "Vegan Hash Browns": "Ingredients: it took me many many attempts to arrive at the optimal oven temperature, decide if the mixture benefits from the addition of flour, aquafaba, ground flax or parboiling potatoes! Finally, I\u2019ve settled on two versions below., I roped Duncan into the final stages of taste testing and while he thinks (he hoovered them up too quickly to be sure \ud83d\ude09 ) he prefers the version with the raw potato mixture, I prefer the one with the parboiled potatoes, so I\u2019ve decided to include both. They are both very crispy \u2013 surprisingly so given how little oil I\u2019ve used and my preferred version is a touch softer / mashier inside. They go well with vegan sour cream, ketchup or guacamole. They will also make a fine vegan breakfast, served alongside some garlicky spinach and jammy, oven-roasted tomatoes, for example.

If using parboiled potatoes, there is no need to do that and skip the next step too!, , After 10 minutes, place the raw potato mixture in the middle of a clean muslin cloth or kitchen towel and squeeze all the excess moisture out. Drain the water away and you will end up with potato starch stuck to the bottom of the bowl \u2013 it is the starch that makes for crispy hash browns so scoop it up and add it back to the mixture. Break compacted mixture up with a fork or your hands after squeezing the liquid out., , Using a brush or an oil spray, spread a bit of oil underneath each hash brown, place a cookie cutter on the oiled area and loosely pile the mixture inside the cookie cutter (to just under 1 cm / 0.35 \u201d height), but DON\u2019T COMPACT the mixture. Use a fork to ensure the mixture is spread fairly evenly and it goes all the way to the edges \u2013 make sure the mixture is piled up loosely \u2013 this way it will cook all the way through and the hash browns won\u2019t be tough. If you would rather freestyle, that\u2019s fine too \u2013 use a spoon, don\u2019t flatten the mixture too much and tidy the edges up with a knife to avoid them getting burnt., , Bake the raw potato hash browns for 20 minutes and parboil ones for about 10 then carefully detach from the tray using a flat spatula. Brush the surface of the baking tray with oil again and flip each hash brown making sure that it sits directly on the oiled patch. Bake for a further 15-20 minutes (raw potato hash browns) and 10-15 minutes (parboiled potato hash browns)., , Serve straight away with vegan sour cream/creme fraiche or ketchup \u2013 whichever takes your fancy., NOTES, *Large potatoes will take a minute or two more and small a minute or two less, of course., For more indulgent hash browns (but not as healthy so I guess you might as well fry them), stir 1-2 tbsp of oil through the mixture before forming hash browns., SHARE, , , , , , , NUTRITIONAL INFO, calories, 82, 4%, sugars, 1 g, 1%, fats, 2 g, 3%, saturates, 0 g, 2%, proteins, 2 g, 3%, carbs, 14 g, 5%, *per hash brown, YOU MAY ALSO LIKE, , , , , Quick ramen, , , , , Tahini pasta with Brussels sprouts, , , , , Vegan chicken soup, , , , , Sweet potato fritters (baked and fried), , , , , Aubergine bake with cashew bechamel, , , , , Shredded tofu tacos, , , , , Baked zucchini fritters, , , , , Warm butter bean salad, REVIEW or ASK a question, How would you rate this recipe?, This is a test string, Leave a Reply, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , , Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment., Your email address will not be published or used to send you SPAM ever!, \u0394, 5.0, 17 reviews, 53 comments, REVIEWS & QUESTIONS, paula:, REPLY, 1 Mar 2024, I tried these twice, once par-boiled and once raw, and both times they fall apart when I try to gently flip them. They still seem too wet when flipping (even after squeezing out the liquid for the raw version and adding back in). Would it work for the raw version if I didn't add the liquid back in?, , Ania:, REPLY, 1 Mar 2024, Hi Paula,, I think the issue is that you are adding the liquid back in. The whole point of squeezing the potatoes out is to be able to get rid of extra moisture so that liquid needs to be drained away. The only thing that you may want to add back is the starch that settles at the bottom of the bowl. You can also skip that and add a bit of shop bought potato starch instead. Hope this helps.

Ania, , , Taylor:, REPLY, 25 Jun 2020, So I followed exactly and did the parboil potatoes but after the recommended time it looked nothing like a properly baked hash brown. It was still pale and I promise I didn't pack it into my egg rings. Where could I have gone wrong?, , Ania:, REPLY, 27 Jun 2020, Hi Taylor,, It could be the type of potatoes you are using. The best potatoes for this kind of dish are the starchy (not the waxy) kind. The waxy potatoes are slow to brown and are less crispy. Otherwise, maybe they simply need a bit more time in your oven, every oven is different. Hope that helps!

My pleasure and stay well! x Ania, , , Alexandra:, REPLY, 21 Mar 2020, Would this recipe work as well with sweet potatoes?, Thanks!, , Ania:, REPLY, 21 Mar 2020, Hi Alexandra,, Yes Instructions: , If you want crispy hash browns with a softer interior, parboil medium* potatoes for 5 minutes, drain and allow them to cool completely. It\u2019s not necessary though, you can also just use raw potatoes but they produce crispier hash browns with less softness inside. I\u2019ve included both options below., , Grate raw or cooled parboiled potatoes coarsely in a food processor or using a manual grater., , Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0 C / 355\u00b0 F (no fan) for raw potato hash browns and 200\u00b0 C / 390\u00b0 F for par-boiled potato ones.

Ania, , , Salome Watton:, REPLY, 5 Aug 2020, Hi Ania, I would like to add vegan cheese to these. Do you have a suggestion as to how much grated cheese to add? Thanks so much. - Salome, , Ania:, REPLY, 6 Aug 2020, Hi Salome,, I'm not sure that will work very well, unless you managed to find vegan cheese that behaves exactly like dairy cheese when melted - in my experience it tends to turns into an oily mess when melted. I'm not sure about the quantity either - depends on your preference, I guess. I would go by feel.

Ania, , , Lucy:, REPLY, 9 Jan 2020, I\u2019ll definitely be trying these, I\u2019ve never managed to make a successful hash brown myself but always tried with raw potatoes so I think parboiled is the way to go!, Ania I am also a food snob but tinned spaghetti hoops are my default food for when I\u2019m ill, you can\u2019t beat them.

Saut\u00e9 everything for a couple of minutes, season with salt, pepper, and the spice mix., Split the dough into 8 parts (about 1/2 cup or 120 g each). Form into balls, make a well in the middle, and add about one and a half tablespoons of the filling. You can also add some, vegan cheese, (I used, vegan cheese sauce, ) in addition. Carefully \"seal\" the balls with more dough and flatten them slightly to make them look like thick pancakes., Heat approximately 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan and fry the potato cakes at medium heat until golden brown on both sides.

Even though I haven\u2019t tried it myself, I received a couple of messages from my followers on Instagram who told me that they tried it. The result was good, but the potato cakes weren\u2019t as crispy., , I would, therefore, recommend brushing them with a little oil from both sides and then bake them in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (ca. 190 \u00b0C) until golden brown (flipping halfway through)., , How To Store?, , Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days.

Let cool completely, then freeze in freezer bags with wax paper in between for up to three months., , , Great As A Snack On The Go/Meal Prep, , These vegan potato cakes are perfect for lunch or dinner.

(Please do not use a food processor, otherwise, the mashed potatoes will be sticky)., Allow the mashed potatoes to cool (in the meantime you can prepare the filling), then add flour and cornstarch and mix well with a spoon or your hands., Filling:, Chop the veggies into small pieces, fry the onion in a pan with a little oil for about 3-4 minutes, add the mushrooms, garlic, and also the diced peppers and the zucchini. Saut\u00e9 everything for a couple of minutes, season with salt, pepper, and the spice mix., Split the dough into 8 parts (about 1/2 cup or 120 g each). Form into balls, make a well in the middle, and add about one and a half tablespoons of the filling. You can also add some, vegan cheese, (I used, vegan cheese sauce, ) in addition. Carefully \"seal\" the balls with more dough and flatten them slightly to make them look like thick pancakes., Heat approximately 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan and fry the potato cakes at medium heat until golden brown on both sides.

You can probably use instant potatoes (I never tried it), but the texture might be a bit softer than using freshly mashed potatoes.
