        "Buttermilk apple pancakes": "Ingredients: , , , , , , , , buttermilk apple pancakes, ., , 1., Whole wheat flour (gehun ka atta), . Whole wheat flour adds a subtle nutty flavor to the pancakes, which can complement the sweetness of the apples and the tang of the buttermilk. Compared to white flour pancakes, whole wheat pancakes can have a slightly chewy texture. This can be a desirable quality for some people, adding a bit more substance to the bite. Many recipes call for using a combination of whole wheat flour and white flour. This allows you to enjoy the health benefits of whole wheat while still maintaining a lighter and fluffier texture from the white flour., 2. Buttermilk. The subtle tang of buttermilk complements the sweetness of the apples and the overall flavor profile of the pancakes. It adds a layer of complexity that plain milk wouldnt provide. Buttermilk is slightly acidic due to the lactic acid produced during fermentation. This acidity reacts with the baking soda in the pancake batter, creating carbon dioxide bubbles. These bubbles cause the pancakes to rise and become fluffy. Since eggless pancakes lack the leavening power of eggs, buttermilk becomes even more important for achieving a good rise and a light, tender texture., , Pro tips for, buttermilk apple pancakes, . 1. Add 1 cup finely, chopped apple, . Chopped apples offer distinct bursts of apple flavor in each bite, enhancing the overall taste of the pancakes. Chopped apples generally cook faster than grated apples because they are larger pieces. This is important for eggless pancakes, which rely on proper cooking through other means (like baking powder) and might require slightly longer cooking times than traditional pancakes. 2. Add 1 1/2 tbsp, maple syrup, or, honey, . Apples also add sweetness to the pancakes, but they often have a tart or tangy component as well.

        "Apple cinnamon crepes": "Ingredients: , Not only are these apple crepes vegan, , , Gluten-Free Flour:, I used a combination of oat flour, rice flour, and cornstarch. However, a gluten-free 1:1 all-purpose flour blend, regular wheat flour, or spelt flour (if you aren\u2019t gluten-free) instead of oat flour and rice flour should be fine too. Buckwheat flour and quinoa flour might work great as well! You can use arrowroot flour instead of cornstarch., , Sweetener:, Use coconut sugar, organic brown sugar, or cane sugar. They all add a lovely caramel flavor., , Ground flax seeds:, It\u2019s fine to use ground chia seeds., , Plant-based milk:, I like using canned lite coconut milk (or regular canned coconut milk thinned with water) as it will make the apple crepes more flavorful. If you use boxed almond milk, oat milk, or any other dairy-free milk that is low-fat, I would suggest adding 3 tbsp oil to the batter, otherwise, the gluten-free crepes might stick to the pan., , Banana:, You can use applesauce instead of banana., , Lemon juice:, Or use lime juice., , Vanilla extract:, Or use vanilla bean paste., , Apples:, You can use your favorite baking/cooking apples. Some examples, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Jonathon, Gala, or Braeburn., , Baking powder, , Oil for frying, , , For the, ingredient measurements, and nutritional information,, read the recipe card below., , , How To Make Apple Crepes, , Below, , Step 2:, you can mix them in a bowl., , Step 3:, , Step 4:, Let the batter rest for a few minutes. Heat a little oil in a small/medium-sized non-stick pan., , Step 5:, Pour 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet and swirl it around to coat the pan evenly. Cook the crepe for about 2-4 minutes, or until you can easily lift a side of the crepe (please don\u2019t try to flip it too early). After you flipped the crepe, cook for a further 1-2 minutes., , Note:, After a while, the batter will thicken, so you might need to add more milk, up to 50 ml. Continue until there is no batter left., , Step 6:, To make the apple pie filling, , Step 7:, Add a few tsp of the filling onto each crepe, roll it up, sprinkle with granulated sugar (of choice), and cinnamon (this step is optional). I like to add a\u00a0drizzle of caramel sauce. Enjoy!, , , Apple Crepe Filling, , The filling reminds me of an, apple pie, which is one of my favorite pies! I sometimes also add raisins, rum extract, and vanilla extract. Pumpkin spice or allspice is also a nice addition. You can peel the apples (like I did) or leave the peel on if you prefer., , It\u2019s possible to make the apple crepe filling sugar-free, by using a low-carb (keto) sweetener like Erythritol. But then it won\u2019t have this yummy caramel flavor., , Recipe Notes, , , I recommend using a, non-stick pan, since you will need very little oil to cook the vegan crepes., , Cook them at, medium heat, . Low won\u2019t make them brown, and high heat will brown the edges too much but won\u2019t cook the inside properly., , You can experiment with, other flours, (as mentioned above), however, please note that the recipe turned out perfectly with the flours that I used., , Use two pans, to speed up the cooking process., , Stack the cooked crepes and, cover them with a kitchen towel, to keep them warm and prevent them from drying out., , , , water, and nut butter of choice. I actually used sunflower seed butter (Sunbutter) but any nut butter like peanut butter will work. Check the recipe notes to find out how I made it.

After you flipped the crepe, cook for a further 1-2 minutes., Note:, After a while, the batter will get thicker, so you might need to add more milk. I typically add up to 50 ml in addition once the batter thickens. Continue until you have no batter left., For the apple filling, Place a few tsp of filling onto each crepe, roll it up and serve with a drizzle of caramel sauce (see recipe below in the notes). Enjoy!, , , Notes, Video Of The Recipe, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Oats:, You can use regular oats or gluten-free oats. To make oat flour, simply process the oats in a blender or in an, electric coffee/spice grinder, ., , Rice flour:, Instead of rice flour, you should be able to use, buckwheat flour, quinoa flour, or even all-purpose flour, (if not gluten-free). Do, not, use coconut flour though as it's very absorbent. Almond flour probably won't work either, but I never tried it., , Cornstarch:, Arrowroot flour should be fine too., , Banana:, You can use 80 g of, applesauce, instead of banana., , Milk:, If you use boxed almond milk, oat milk, or any other dairy-free milk that is low-fat, I would suggest adding, 3 tbsp oil, to the batter, otherwise, the crepes might stick to the pan., , Use two pans, to speed up the cooking process., , Stack the cooked crepes and, cover them with a kitchen towel, to keep them warm and prevent them from drying out., , Watch the video above, The crepes cooked beautifully i was so so surprised! I got some cripsy edges too. I only added a very small amount of oil for every other crepe and none of them stuck to the pan., Actually, my batter barely thicken up as others have mentioned. Maybe because i used quinoa flour and maybe because i made half the recipe., I ended up with 6 beautiful crepes., I made my own filling using cashew butter, cinnamon sugar, and some leftover apple sauce to get a good consistency., , Thank you so much for the recipe and for your incredibly helpful notes.

I was hoping to make it as it looked so good and not the dark brown colour of most apple butters.  Also, I made your apple crepes and they were delicious., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Ela, , , 13.
