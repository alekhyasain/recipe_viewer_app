        "Healthy Veggie Frittata": "Ingredients: , , , Vegetables, \u2013 For this frittata recipe, I am using zucchini, peppers, and onions, but feel free to use whatever vegetables you love or have on hand. This is such a flexible recipe!, , Eggs, \u2013 You\u2019ll need a dozen large eggs for this recipe. I recommend organic pastured eggs., , Milk, \u2013 I used whole milk because that\u2019s what we had on hand, but you can use any milk of choice: skim, 2%, almond, or cashew milk., , Cheese, \u2013 There\u2019s something fabulous about the combination of goat cheese, veggies, and eggs. But, you can use any cheese you\u2019d like. I think feta crumbles would be great too., , , What pan is best for making a frittata?, , Frittatas are very easygoing and can be made in a variety of different pans.\u00a0 You can use a, cast-iron skillet, large, saut\u00e9, pan, muffin cups, or a baking dish, ., , Each pan or dish will create a delicious vegetable frittata, so use what you have on hand or prefer.\u00a0 You will need to adjust the cooking time, depending on the pan you use., I cooked my vegetable frittata in a 9\u00d713\u2033 baking dish and it took about 30 minutes, . You will know your frittata is done when the eggs puff up and the center is set., , If you use a cast-iron skillet or saut\u00e9 pan, the cooking time will be similar (although you, of course, want to keep an eye on it) and if you opt for muffin cups, they should be done in about 20 minutes., , , , How to roast veggies, , You\u00a0definitely\u00a0want to, pre-cook any vegetables, that you\u2019ll be adding to your frittata, otherwise, , , Protein., The recipe as written is vegetarian, but sometimes I like to add in some cooked turkey sausage, cooked diced ham or cooked crumbled bacon., , Vegetables., You can add to the veggies in the recipe or swap any of them out with your favorite cooked vegetables. Some ideas: spinach, mushrooms, baby potatoes, broccoli, asparagus and carrots. Just make sure they are chopped up well and cooked before adding them to the mix., , Cheese., Feel free to omit the cheese to make this recipe dairy-free. You can also swap out the goat cheese with crumbled feta, shredded cheddar cheese or shredded pepper jack., , , What to serve with your breakfast bake, , This easy breakfast bake recipe pairs well with a variety of breakfast sides! Below are some of my favorite options:, , , Apple Chicken Sausage, , Lemon Blueberry Oatmeal Muffins, , Arugula Salad, , Chocolate Chip Scones, , Roasted Sweet Potatoes, , , Storing and freezing recommendations, , This healthy vegetable frittata is perfect for meal prep on Sunday! Leftovers keep well in the fridge and you can enjoy slices of this for breakfast for the next 5 days without having to do any additional cooking!, , , Storing leftovers., Place any leftover frittata in an airtight storage container in the refrigerator for up to about 5 days., , To reheat., Pop individual servings in the microwave and cook for 30-second intervals until warm. You can also place the casserole dish in the oven at 350\u00baF. If using the oven, loosely cover with foil and place the dish on the center rack for 15 to 25 minutes, until warmed through (the larger the serving, the longer the cooking time)., , Freezing., Place leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container or a freezer-safe baggie in the freezer for up to 3 months.

Super tasty. I added some mushrooms as I was cleaning out the fridge \ud83d\ude0a. I found that it was a bit mushy on the inside as it didn\u2019t quite set properly. I think it is due to the watery veggies that I used. Next time I will skip the mushrooms and zucchini and add broccoli and asparagus. New breakfast go to!!!! \ud83d\udc95, , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Julie | The Simple Veganista, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Thanks for sharing, Tammy!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Sasha, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Very Tasty both warm and straight out of the fridge \ud83d\ude0b, , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Silvia R, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I find this recipe delicious. I replaced potatoes with cooked yuca or cassava and is used my skillet instead of the oven. Came out little soft but still worked. Thank you., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Cyndi, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I\u2019ve made this three times and each time it has been delicious.  I use super firm organic tofu and add another 1/4 C vegetable broth to compensate.  We love the firm texture.  I don\u2019t use zucchini because it can be watery so I use broccoli instead, which my family loves.  This is a great recipe! \ud83d\ude42, , , , Reply, , , , , , Comments navigation, , Older comments, , , , Leave a Reply, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , , Recipe rating, , , , , , , , , 5 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 4 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 3 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 2 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 1 Star, , , , , Comment, *, Name, *, , Email, *, , Website, , , , , Notify me of followup comments via e-mail., \u0394, , , , , , , , , , Hi, and welcome to The Simple Veganista where you'll find healthy, affordable, EASY VEGAN RECIPES everyone will love!, Learn more about TSV \u2192, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, , Reader Favorites, , , Vegan Banana Bread (Healthy + Easy), Lemon Chickpea Orzo Soup (Vegan Avgolemono), Chickpea & Sweet Potato Breakfast Hash, 1 Bowl Vegan Peanut Butter Cookies, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Get new recipes in your inbox!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Info, , , Privacy Policy, Disclaimers, Web Accessibility, About TSV, Contact, Vegan Pantry, , , , , , , , , , Follow, , , Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Youtube, Subscribe, by email, RSS, , , , , , , , , , Recipes, , , Breakfast, Snack, Entree, Side, Soup, Salad, , , , , , , , , , Easy Basics, , , Almond Parmesan, Almond Butter, Homemade Tahini, Cashew Ricotta, Vegan Mayo, Vegan Sour Cream, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , \u00a9 2025 THE SIMPLE VEGANISTA \u2022 A Plant Based Vegan Recipe Blog, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Recipes, , Breakfast, , Salad, , Soup, , Dinner, , , , , , , Facebook, , X, , Instagram, , , , Subscribe, , , , About TSV, , , , , , Search, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Toggle Menu Close, , , , , , , , Search for:, , , , , Search, , , , , , , Instructions: Expand, , , , , saute, puree, bake, , Cuisine:, , Italian, , Diet:, , Vegan, , , , , , , , , , Preheat oven to 375 degrees F., , Saute:, Heat oil in a pan over medium heat, saute potatoes for 5 minutes, add onion and cook an additional 5 minutes.
