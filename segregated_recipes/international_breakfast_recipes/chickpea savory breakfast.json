I hope that helps., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Colleen, , says:, , , , at, , , , , I made this for a breakfast for lunch type of meal at church; I almost didn\u2019t take them because of how they turned out. I was anticipating that they would look similar to the picture but they definitely did not. I doubled the recipe to ensure everyone would have one or two each but they was quite soggy in the middle even after letting them sit. They tasted great but they did not look good. They were very dark and I thought it was because of the type of veggies I used. I used eggplant and zucchini beside the corn, etc. So maybe that is why they came out so dark. Otherwise, this recipe was great. I won\u2019t be using left over dark veggies for this again! Lol., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Michael S, , says:, , , , at, , , , , This has been a favorite of mine, with all kinds of veggies.

Thanks!, , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Steve, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Been making these on and off as a side dish to my broccoli heavy stir fry . These also have been side dished for my \u2018vegan chilli\u2019 honestly tho i just call it \u2018the mega bean soup\u2019 i love these so much. I used to wonder how much tastier they could be if i actually used yeast (for some reason it was really hard to find) . I used the yeast for the first time last night (after making this on and off for a year)  and it really was a game changer! I was so blown away by how good i managed to make them that i had to come here to leave this comment. Lol. Great recipe! The non vegans in my household also gobbled these down at light speed. 10/10.  Good as a side dish, dipping into soup, top it with a \u201ccheese\u201d or dip of choice. It has the same flexibility and number of opportunities as a plain loaf of bread.  Will be a staple side dish in most of my future cooking.
