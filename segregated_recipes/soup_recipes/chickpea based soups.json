If you\u2019d like a more mild chili, try using mild green salsa and omitting the, chili powder, ., , If you like a thicker chili, try adding less, vegetable broth, ., The, coconut milk, will make the chili super creamy and then the, vegetable broth, helps to thin that out a bit, but if you want a creamier chili, add less, vegetable broth, \u2013 you can always add more later!, , Be sure to moderately salt this chili!, The ingredient list is simple, and while it does have a few spices in it, salt is going to go a long way in boosting the overall flavors of the dish.

My problem was that it was too bitter tasting/acidity\u2026not sure where it came from. Almost had a lemony/lime taste, but I didn\u2019t add lemons or limes. It didn\u2019t really give me that wholesome chili taste, but not a bad recipe to build from.

It is that good. My kids love it, my friends love it. It is what I bring to friend\u2019s with new babies, post surgery, etc. I  initially made as is (excellent), but have made some modifications based on my family\u2019s preferences: changed the garbanzo beans to cannelini, less chili powder, add 15 oz of frozen corn. Trader\u2019s Joes salsa verde is the perfect amount of spice for us. Also \u2013 for those wondering \u2013 I do not detect any coconut flavor from the coconut milk \u2013 it just adds a wonderful creaminess.
