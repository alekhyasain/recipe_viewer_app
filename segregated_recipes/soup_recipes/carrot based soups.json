I\u2019m so glad you enjoyed it!, , , , , , , , , , , Michelle, , says, , , October 8, 2016 at 2:50 PM, , , , Hi Sabrina! Made the carrot soup today. Turned out pretty good but since i like my soup a little thicker I had to add about a cup of milk. I didn\u2019t have any more broth or I would have used that. After that I felt like it was a little bland. When I added the salt, pepper, herb infused oil it helped. Any suggestion of what I could have added in to bring some flavor back in? The salt definitely helped but I hate to add too much salt so I would have rather used some sort of spice but not sure which would be good., , , , , , , , , Sabrina Modelle, , says, , , October 18, 2016 at 11:23 AM, , , , If you like thicker soup, I\u2019d just cook it with less broth in the beginning or even add extra veg. As far as spices Instructions: , , , Cook onions and olive oil over low heat until well-caramelized and a dark golden brown, stirring infrequently (about 50-60 minutes), , Add carrots, potato, and celery and cook for another 10 minutes, tossing well to coat with olive oil and onions., , Add vegetable stock, turn heat to medium high, and bring to a rapid boil. Cook until vegetables are very tender almost falling apart- about 20 minutes., , Blend with an immersion blender until completely smooth, thinning with just a little bit of stock, water, or milk of your choice if you'd like a thinner soup, , Season with salt and pepper and serve with herb\u00a0oil and a sprinkling of piment d'espelette if using, , , , , While the soup is cooking, finely chop \u00be cup parsley and 2 sprigs thyme in food processor until very tiny., , Add \u00bd cup olive oil and give it a little whirl. Rest the herb oil at room temperature for at least 20 minutes., , When ready to serve, strain through a fine mesh sieve and add one teaspoon of the herbs back to the strained oil and whisk to incorporate., , , , , , 3.3.3077, , , Share this:, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter, , , , Filed Under:, Gluten Free, , , Recipe, , , Soup, , , Vegan, , , Vegetarian, , Tagged With:, carrot, , , Comfort Food, , , dog, , , Gluten Free, , , grain free, , , Healthy, , , hearty, , , McLaren Park, , , Olive Oil, , , onion, , , organic, , , paleo, , , potato, , , Ruby, , , San Francisco, , , seasonal, , , Soup, , , Spicy, , , The Excelsior, , , vegan, , , winter, \u00ab French Potato Salad with Warm Bacon Vinaigrette, Easy Roast Turkey with Herb Butter \u00bb, , , , , Easy Roast Turkey with Herb Butter, Vegan Carrot Soup with Caramelized Onions, French Potato Salad with Warm Bacon Vinaigrette, Instant Pot Vegan Lentil and Mushroom Stew (Gluten Free), , Comments, , , , , , Ginny, , says, , , December 31, 2011 at 10:14 AM, , , , Thanks for sharing, I cant wait to make this!

To get a really deep caramelized flavor, it takes about an hour. I like to do them in big batches so that I always have some in the fridge. You can go for less time, but you won\\\u2019t get that sweet French onion soup flavor., , , , , , , , , , , PRupip, , says, , , November 19, 2013 at 12:46 AM, , , , With only 8 oz of broth, this must only make enough for 2 servings. Is that right? I chop/slice my sweet onions and put in the freezer for winter use, should I use about 3 cups? I share your posts with all my friends that garden and eat fresh/local. What a wonderful site., , , , , , , , , The Tomato Tart, , says, , , November 19, 2013 at 7:24 AM, , , , Thank you so much for your kind words. I also make use of large amounts of caramelized onions. Later today, I am filling my slow cooker with onions so I have them ready for thanksgiving. I\\\u2019ll probably do a total of 10lbs this week. If you freeze them in ice cube trays, it is very convenient to pull out one cube at a time to add to a recipe., To answer your question, this recipe makes about four servings of thick soup. You can add a bit more broth for a thinner soup., This recipe is also very easily scaled up for a crowd., , , , , , , , , Winnie, , says, , , September 2, 2015 at 5:09 PM, , , , I am so intrigued by caramelizing onions in the slow cooker. I love using caramelized onions to thicken gravy for turkey for a gluten free gravy. About how long does it take to do in the slow cooker? I saw that you said that you planned on doing about 10 pounds and freezing.  Can you please share any tips for this? Love the idea of having this on hand. Thank you., , , , , , , , , Sabrina Modelle, , says, , , September 2, 2015 at 7:17 PM, , , , Hi Winnie, I do my onions in the slow cooker all the time. I do between 5-10 lbs and I slice them thinly, put them in the slow cooker on high and let it go for about 12 hours. When the onions are caramelized, I pull the top off the slow cooker and turn the heat down and let them cook until all of the liquid has evaporated between 3-5 hours. Don\u2019t skip the last step because so much of the flavor is right in that liquid., , PS, your gravy sounds totally divine!, , , , , , , , , Zakia, , says, , , November 23, 2015 at 6:31 AM, , , , Hi \u2013 I saw this comment about doing the onions in the slow cooker \u2013 how about doing the entire soup in the slow cooker? I would love to make this soup as a post Thanksgiving treat. How do you recommend adjusting the recipe? \u2013 thanks!, , , , , , , , , Sabrina Modelle, , says, , , November 23, 2015 at 10:26 AM, , , , Hi Zakia, I would do the onions first. Just onions and a bit of oil in the slow cooker on high for 6-8 hours (overnight would work great) and then in the last hours of cooking, remove the lid to reduce the liquid. Don\u2019t throw the liquid out, all the onion flavor is concentrated in there. You must reduce it to make the onions taste good., , Note, if you are only doing the amount of onions necessary for this soup recipe, you could skip the step of reducing the liquid and just reduce the amount of liquid called for in the soup recipe., , I might switch up the herb oil to be cilantro, ginger, and parsley. You could even go Mexican with a bit of chili, lime, and some cumin!  If you wanted to say in the Euro/French family, I would try some dried tarragon and a bit of dried mustard. I\u2019d love to know what you try and see how it turns out., , , , , , , , , , , Megan, , says, , , December 12, 2016 at 1:25 PM, , , , Your dog is so cute!

        "Ginger and Tumeric Carrot Soup": "Ingredients: this is the perfect winter soup., , , It\u2019s not exactly a secret that I love healthy soups, especially when the weather turns cold. And when the holidays roll around? Well that\u2019s when I really love to break out this ginger and turmeric carrot soup. Not only is this soup hearty and comforting for the cold months, turmeric, carrots, so an anti-inflammatory soup can be just what the doctor ordered around the holidays.\u00a0Plus, it's vegan!, , But this soup isn\u2019t just about being healthy. It\u2019s also bursting with flavor. Ginger, garlic, fennel, and leeks give the soup a vibrant, fresh kick, while carrots, squash, and coconut milk make it rich and creamy. You\u2019re sure to feel cozy, comforted, and healthy after a warm bowl of this easy-to-make soup., , , What You\u2019ll Need, , , , Olive oil, , Leek, , Fennel, \u2013 This recipe uses fresh fennel, not fennel seeds., , Carrots, , Butternut squash, \u2013 You can use other types of squash, but butternut is definitely preferable., , Garlic, , Ginger, \u2013 You\u2019ll need to grate the ginger., , Turmeric powder, , Salt, , Pepper, , Vegetable broth, \u2013 I like to use a low-sodium veggie broth., , Coconut milk, \u2013 Lite coconut milk is my preference for this recipe, rather than full-fat coconut milk., , , , How to Make Anti-Inflammatory Ginger and Turmeric Carrot Soup, , This soup takes less than an hour to make, but tastes like it\u2019s been simmering away on your stove all day long. Here\u2019s how to make it., , , Cook the veggies., Heat the olive oil in a large pan or dutch oven. Add the carrots, squash, fennel, and leeks, and saut\u00e9 until the veggies start to soften. This should take 3-5 minutes. Then add the ginger, garlic, turmeric, salt, and pepper, and saut\u00e9 for 2-3 more minutes., , Add the liquid., Pour in the vegetable broth and coconut milk. Bring the soup to a boil, then lower the temperature, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes., , Blend., Add the soup to a blender, and blend until it is smooth and creamy., , Season., Taste the soup and adjust the seasonings as necessary. Then serve!, , , Tips and Tricks, , Here are some tricks and tips for making the best anti-inflammatory winter soup., , , Make your own broth., As with most soup recipes, this ginger and turmeric carrot soup is excellent with a nice store-bought vegetable broth. But you can turn the soup into something truly special with your own homemade broth. I like to use, Instant Pot mushroom vegan bone broth, for this recipe., , Go light on the salt., When making soup, it\u2019s a good idea to only use a little bit of salt at the start. The reason for this is that different vegetable broths, whether store-bought or homemade, have different sodium levels. And the saltiness of your soup will depend on how much you cook it down. Start small with the salt, and adjust the seasonings at the very end., , Add some fun toppings., I love to top this soup with some vegan coconut yogurt and fresh parsley. But you can have lots of fun with the toppings of your choice. This ginger and turmeric carrot soup would be delicious topped with croutons, lemon or orange zest, vegan cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, crispy shallots, or fresh basil., , , , Serving Suggestions, , I love serving this healthy soup with an, air fryer grilled cheese sandwich, on the side. It's crunchy, easy to make, and healthier than traditional ways of cooking grilled cheese. You could also serve this soup with, popovers, , , cloud bread, , or even warm tortillas rolled up around some melty cheese., , How to Store Ginger and Turmeric Carrot Soup, , This is one of my favorite soups to make ahead of time, because it stores well. Keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days, and reheat over medium heat on the stove for 3-5 minutes. You can also reheat in the microwave in 30-second intervals on 80% power., , Can This Recipe Be Frozen?, , Yes! Store this soup in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 6 months. Thaw or defrost completely before reheating., , , More Healthy and Cozy Soups to Make, , If you want some more comforting and healing soups to make, then check out these recipes., , , Healing Cauliflower Holiday Soup, , Lemon & Garlic Wild Rice Soup, , Creamy Chili Roasted Pumpkin Soup, , Vegan White Bean & Mushroom Soup, , , , , , Anti-Inflammatory Ginger and Turmeric Carrot Soup, , , 4.9, from, 21, votes, , , This delicious ginger and turmeric carrot soup is as comforting as it is healing.
