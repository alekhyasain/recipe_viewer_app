        "Vegan Lentil Tortilla Soup": "Ingredients: aside from the lime juice, we\u2019ll add that at the end., , I used 3 cups of veggie broth because I wanted this on the thicker side, if you like it more brothy, use 4. If you\u2019re not sure, start with 3 and add more at the end if you want to thin it out., , Stir everything well to combine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally., , , After about 20 minutes, taste to check to see if the lentils are fully cooked. Let simmer for 5-10 more minutes if they still have a crunch to them., , Once the lentils are done, transfer 2 cups worth of soup to a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer back to the pot and stir to combine. Stir in the lime juice. Taste and adjust flavors as desired, and/or add more broth to thin it out if you like., , Garnish with tortilla strips, chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice, avocado and vegan sour cream. Plain yogurt also works well if you don\u2019t like sour cream!, , , Homemade tortilla strips, , I had a hard time finding certified gluten free tortilla strips at the market when I was shopping for this recipe, so I opted to make my own and it was actually SO easy! All you\u2019ll need is a few corn tortillas, oil of your choice (I used avocado) and some salt., , What you want to do is slice the tortillas into thin strips, then slice in the other direction to get about 1 inch long and 1/4 inch wide strips. Add some oil to a pot on the stove (enough to cover the bottom of the pan with about 1/2 inch layer)., , Once it\u2019s hot, throw in the strips and let fry for a few minutes on each side until crispy. It helps to do this in small batches so the tortillas aren\u2019t all on top of each other and crowded., , Remove from the pan and place on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil. Top with a few cracks of salt., , , How to store and freeze, , Once prepared, this vegan tortilla soup will keep in the fridge for about 3 days. You can reheat it on the stove or microwave. It does thicken up a bit as it sits in the fridge, so you may want to add a splash of veggie broth when you reheat it., , Once the soup is cooked, allow it to cool completely, then transfer it to an air tight and freezer safe container. Freeze for up to 2 months. Allow it to thaw in the fridge overnight before reheating., , I like to freeze it in smaller containers so I can thaw just what I need at any time!, , , Serving suggestions, , I like to serve this vegan tortilla soup as the main dish since it\u2019s nice and hearty from the beans and lentils., , My favorite toppings include fresh lime juice, avocado, lots of chopped cilantro and sour cream. Ok, I actually don\u2019t like sour cream, so I just use leftover cashew cream and pretend to the people I\u2019m serving it to that it\u2019s sour cream.

It was really good.  I like that it is filling, satisfying, and not heavy.  You can eat a lot of this soup without feeling heavy.  I added kidney beans, as well, and you can add whatever you want in the soup to customize it.  I think it would taste delicious as well.  We had them with quesadillas or toasted and buttered ciabatta bread.  Wondering if what gives a tortilla soup its distinct flavor is all the sour cream and cheese in it, lol, which defeats the purpose of it being vegan.  Despite it not tasting like a tortilla soup, I will be making it again!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Stephanie, , says, , , December 12, 2023 at 12:57 am, , , , This turned out sooo well!

This soup is delicious! One of the first new things I\u2019ve made recently that the boyfriend said it can be put in a regular rotation he thought it was that good. He eats meat and I don\u2019t, but I still want to find things we can both enjoy and the flavor of this soup was it! I may find a way to add a little more heat to it next time, but it\u2019s great as is! I may as well note, though I had everything just in my pantry already, I did not have any bell pepper, so I diced carrots for some of that sweetness and it worked just as well!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Claire Cary, , says, , , October 19, 2023 at 8:34 pm, , , , Perfect, thanks Jessica!

Coconut milk totally works \u2013 I ended up using a whole 15ish oz can since I didn\u2019t want to bother storing it for later. I agree with other reviewers that 3 cups broth is plenty! Spices are always a little bit of preference/ trial and error- I likely did them heavy handed. I also went heavy handed with the lime juice at the end. I\u2019ve found with other soups, that I prefer to add lime juice right into the individual bowl as I feel that retains the flavor better.
