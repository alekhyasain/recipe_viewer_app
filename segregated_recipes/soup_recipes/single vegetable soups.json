This soup\u2019s heart and soul is fresh, ripe in season vegetables. It doesn\u2019t call for many spices so that the flavours of the veggies can be celebrated and not overpowered. However I recommend you add a bit of curry paste for a flavour that would complement these veggies., , , , , , , , 0, , , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Karen, , , , , , Posted: 4 years ago, , , , , , This soup was delicious!

Reading the reviews, my main take is taste test and know your personal preference. I LOVE garlic so I tripled that and added it in to the roast. I had some extra broccoli stems so I sliced that and put it in the oven also., Besides that, I kept it all the same, tasted it and salted and pepper it to my liking. My kids liked it and to add some texture I made GF pasta noodles and shredded some zucchini., It was very good both ways, I think it is great simple and for a heartier meal you can oomf it up., Thanks for a delicious meal, I will make it again for sure., , , , , , , , 0, , , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Ana (The Busy Baker Team), , , Editor, , , , , , , Reply to, Sara T, , , , Posted: 2 years ago, , , , , , We\u2019re so happy you enjoyed it!

Place each half flat side down and cut into strips about 1/4 wide. They will look like little semi circles as they fall apart., Heat the butter and olive oil on a medium/low heat until the butter is completely melted. Add the onion, stir to coat then cover and let cook for 10 minutes. The heat should be low enough that the onions do not brown but just begin to get soft. After the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium, add the sugar and stir the onions once every 10 minutes. Do not cover the onions for this. Repeat stirring every 10 minutes until 1 hour has passed and the onions are brown and caramelized. The magic will start to happen around 45-50 minutes., Add the minced garlic, white wine, salt and pepper to the onions and let cook for a couple of minutes. Then add the vegetable stock, thyme and bay leaves, reduce the heat to low and let simmer for 1 hour., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit. (175 degrees Celsius) Spoon the soup into bowls, top with a slice of french bread and then generously cover the entire dish with Gruyere cheese. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes before switching it to grill (broil) for the last couple of minutes to let the cheese turn golden brown., Serve immediately., , , Notes, Notes: If you want to make the soup and serve it later, stop at the end of step 3 and store the soup in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
