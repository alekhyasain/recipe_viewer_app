A wok helps in distribution of heat evenly and the huge circumference helps in easy hand movement while stirring hence, it is suggested in Indo-Chinese cooking when the vegetables are generally sauteed on high heat.

        "Mixed veg soup": "Ingredients: , , , , 6, , How to Make Mix Veg Soup with Step-by-step Photos, , , , , 7, , Notes, , , , , As I mentioned, the, mixed veg soup recipe, has a similar texture and taste to the popular straightforward soup recipe. Yet, there are several differences between these two recipes. The main distinctive difference is the texture or consistency of the soup liquid. The vegetables are boiled in this recipe, and corn flour slurry is added for a thick broth. In clear soup, vegetables are cooked and spiced with pepper and salt to taste. In other words, there aren\u2019t any extra steps compared to this recipe, thus making it more simple and easy. Moreover, with, mixed, vegetable soup, , particular vegetables have to be added (mentioned below), unlike its later comparison., , , , , , , , Furthermore, here are some easy and essential tips, suggestions, and variations for a perfect and rich mixed, vegetable soup recipe, . Firstly, the vegetables used in this recipe should be finely chopped and not in large shape. Large vegetables would not be easy to boil and cook for the soup. Secondly, try to experiment with vegetable choices and do not limit yourself to some particular vegetables. I have tried to use some basic veggies for this recipe, but you are more than welcome to explore. Lastly, the soup must be served warm and tastes better when rested. Hence, prepare it well in advance and, microwave, it just before serving., Finally, I request you to check my other detailed, Soup Recipe Collection, with this post of, vegetable soup recipes, . It mainly includes my other related recipes like, lemon coriander soup, , , bonda soup, , , sweet corn soup, , , beetroot soup, , , lemon rasam, , , punarpuli saaru, , , carrot soup, , , pumpkin soup, , , palak soup, , and, rasam, .

But this soup is made in a pressure cooker, thus making it one of the simple and effective soup recipes. The recipe or the soup texture is very similar to thick tomato soup, but it is not mandatory to make it that way. The same set of veggies can also be boiled in veggie stock to make a simple,, filling soup., , In addition, to being simple, tasty, and flavoured, it is also a healthy and nutrient-rich soup recipe., Vegetable Soup, or, Veggie Soup, making it easily digestible and filling. Also, this soup can be served just before the meal as an appetizer,, thus making digestion straightforward., , Pro Tips for Vegetable Soup, , , , Seasonal Vegetables \u2014, The best flavour and taste of the soup are derived from using fresh seasonal and local vegetable combinations to prepare this healthy soup. Moreover, these vegetables should be crunchy and crisp in texture and not fully cooked., , Protein Touch \u2014, Besides the myriad combinations of vegetables, and for vegetarians, you can add lentils, chickpeas, and beans., , Seasonings \u2014, yet it needs additional toppings and seasonings to make it more flavorful. You may add lemon juice, salt, and pepper to make it lip-smacking in taste., , Texture \u2013, Typically, the soup is prepared in a thin and watery texture, but it can be extended per individual preferences. If the soup is served for lunch and dinner, you can add lentils or yoghurt with a thick texture., , Garnish \u2014, Decorate the soup with additional toppings like sliced garlic and ginger. Adding sliced onion shoots or coriander leaves can make it more tasty and flavourful., , , Video Recipe, , , Recipe Card for Vegetable Soup, , , , , , , , , Vegetable Soup Recipe | Mix Veg Soup - Fat

        "Mexican vegetable soup": "Ingredients: so this could definitely be considered a diet-friendly soup (just don\u2019t serve it up with the tortilla chips like I did)., , It\u2019s like a traditional vegetable or minestrone soup with a hint of Mexican flavors and if you\u2019re lucky enough to have any left it will make for perfect lunch the next day., , , If you are trying to eat healthier this soup is a great place to start. It\u2019s easy to make gluten-free, and it\u2019s the perfect way to get a ton of bunch of veggies in your diet in one sitting. You can add shredded chicken to make this a more protein-rich and filling dish for dinner., , I like to top this soup with cheese, diced avocado, diced red onion, and crispy tortilla strips, , How Can I Make Vegetable Soup More Spicy?, , You can also add a jalapeno pepper, adobo, or some chipotle peppers if you want to add in some heat (note that it will have a mild heat to it because of the green chilies so if you don\u2019t like any heat just use plain canned tomatoes). Increase the chili powder, too., , , Use Up Other Vegetables You Have on Hand, , You can swap out the veggies here with others you might have on hand like peas, asparagus, potatoes, cauliflower, etc. And if you are looking to just cut the list down you can omit green beans because you\u2019ve already got the zucchini so they aren\u2019t really a must., , What Should I Make with the Remaining 1/2 Can Tomatoes?, , You can add the remaining canned tomatoes to taco salad, , chili, , or scrambled eggs, or freeze the remaining half to make this soup again later., , , , , Follow Cooking Classy, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, , , , , 16 Quick & Easy 30 Minute Recipes!, (plus weekly recipe updates), , , , Your email, , , , , , , , , , , , , 5, from, 26, votes, , Print, Recipe, , , Mexican Vegetable Soup, , , , Review Recipe, , , Pin, , , Save, Saved, , , , A deliciously healthy, low fat, low calorie, veggie packed soup!

Peel the carrots, then either slice them thinly, use a vegetable peeler to slice them into ribbons, or cut them into thin sticks (julienne)., Add the canola oil, grated ginger, and the sliced white ends of the green onion to a large pot. Saut\u00e9 the ginger and onion over medium heat until soft (1-2 minutes). Add the vegetable broth to the pot, along with the soy sauce, vinegar, and chili garlic sauce. The amount of soy sauce, vinegar, and chili garlic sauce needed may be subjective and will depend on how much salt your vegetable broth contains. Start with a smaller amount of each, then add more to your taste. The final broth should be tangy and spicy. Heat the broth until piping hot., Drain the tofu, then cut it into small cubes (small enough to fit on a spoon). Add the tofu to the hot broth, and allow it to heat through ( a few minutes)., Either add the sliced vegetables to the soup pot and cook until softened, or divide the vegetables into individual bowls for serving, then spoon the hot broth over top. Sprinkle the sliced green portion of the green onions over each bow. More chili garlic sauce can also be added to each bowl if desired., See how we, calculate recipe costs here, ., , , , , Equipment, Chef\u2019s Knife, Color Cutting Boards, Liquid Measuring Cup, Grater, , Nutrition, Serving:, 1, Serving, Calories:, 131.5, kcal, Carbohydrates:, 13.05, g, Protein:, 9.12, g, Fat:, 5.72, g, Sodium:, 1068, mg, Fiber:, 3.28, g, , , Read our full, nutrition disclaimer here., , , Have you tried this recipe?, Mention, @budgetbytes, or tag, #budgetbytes, on Instagram!, , , , , , Scroll down to see the step by step photos!, , , How to Make Hot and Sour Soup \u2013 Step by Step Photos, , , Begin by prepping all of the vegetables. I used 1/4 head red cabbage (STILL trying to use up that cabbage weeks later!), an 8oz. container of button mushrooms, about 4 green onions, and a few carrots., , , Thinly slice the cabbage, mushrooms, and green onions (you\u2019ll be using both the green and white ends of the green onions at different points, so keep them separated). You can either cut the carrots into very thin sticks (julienne), or use a vegetable peeler to make thin ribbons (or hey, use a spiralizer!)., , , Grate about 1 Tbsp of fresh ginger, as well. I keep this little knob of ginger in my freezer and it really does make it SO much easier to grate. No stringy stuff clogging up the grater! :D, , , Add the white portion of the sliced green onions and the grated ginger to a large soup pot along with 1 Tbsp canola oil. Saut\u00e9 the onion and ginger over medium heat until soft (about one or two minutes)., , , Add six cups of vegetable broth. I use Better Than Bouillon concentrate to make my broth. 1 tsp BTB + 1 cup water = 1 cup broth., , , To the broth you\u2019ll want to add about 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce (depending on how salty your broth already is), and 1.5 to 2 Tbsp of rice vinegar. Rice vinegar has a very mild flavor, but still has that nice tangy-sour effect. I like mine pretty sour, so I added 2 Tbsp of vinegar, but if you\u2019re unsure, start with a smaller amount and add more until you get the broth where you like it., , , For the hot component of the \u201chot and sour\u201d broth, I used 1 Tbsp chili garlic sauce. You could also use sambal olek or even sriracha. If you don\u2019t want your soup spicy at all, just leave it out., , , Once you have the broth hot and sour to your liking, let it heat through until it\u2019s piping hot., , , Take one 14oz. block of extra firm tofu and drain the liquid from the package., , , Cut the tofu into small cubes. You want the cubes small enough to fit on a soup spoon. I ended up making the rest of my cubes a bit smaller than the cubes shown above., , , Finally, add the tofu cubes to the hot broth and let them warm through. They\u2019ll absorb some of that super flavorful broth and get nice and tasty. At this point, you can add all of your sliced vegetables to the pot and let them get nice and tender, or\u2026, , , Divide the sliced vegetables into individual bowls, and\u2026, , , Pour the hot broth right over the thinly sliced vegetables. The hot broth will soften the vegetables just a bit, leaving you with a very fresh and tasty soup., , , Sprinkle a few of the sliced green onions over top and add more chili garlic sauce if you like it super hot!, , , Or, just add all the vegetable to the pot and let them cook a little. Cooked red cabbage does lose it\u2019s nice vibrant color, so just keep in mind that it won\u2019t be quite as pretty this way (but still just as delicious!)., , If you find you have more sliced vegetables than you can use in the soup, switch it up one night and make them into a quick stir fry! Or, add them into your, Dragon Noodles, . :), , Share this recipe, Facebook, WhatsApp, Email, Pin, Posted in:, Asian Inspired Recipes, , , East Asian, , , Globally Inspired Recipes, , , Recipes, , , Recipes under $10, , , Soup Recipes, , , Tofu Recipes, , , Under $1.50 per serving, , , Vegan Recipes, , , Vegetable Recipes, , , Vegetarian Recipes, , , Vegetarian Soup Recipes, Beth Moncel, I\u2019m a food lover, number cruncher, and meticulous budgeter.

It\u2019s so easy, healthy, cheap, and filling. I do add a chopped bell pepper for added veggies. I also double the vinegar, soy sauce, and chili garlic sauce, as I found the recipe as written isn\u2019t as strong in flavor as I would like, but that\u2019s just a personal preference., , , , , , , , , , , 0, , , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , , , Jesi, , , 01.27.23 11:10 am, , , , , This is a really easy and versatile recipe. I usually use coleslaw mix (the bagged shredded lettuce and carrots) with lots of onion and mushrooms.  Siracha will work in a pinch for the heat but if you use it add some garlic.

Also place it on parchment paper. Roast for ~ 20-30 min? flip it over after 15-20 min. you want it nicely coated with a bit of texture, but not overcooked, so watch to not overcook.  Then add this to the soup, rather than just \u2018naked\u2019 tofu.

        "Wild Rice Soup with Veggies": "Ingredients: , , Uncooked wild rice, - I prefer to buy 100 % wild rice for this soup. I know it is expensive but you only need a cup to serve four. Also I do not like the wild rice blend because for the price, you get lot more white and brown rice and very little wild rice in that mix.\u00a0 You will also love our wonderful recipe of, Wild Rice Pilaf Stuffing, for holiday menu., , Vegetables, - I use an array of colorful fresh vegetables. Baby Bella mushrooms, white onion, garlic, celery, carrots, baby spinach and sweet potato are my favorites. These vegetables keep their form and don't mush out in cooking for long time. If you do not like mushed veggies in your soup, cook wild rice separately and then add in all the veggies and make soup that way., , Flavors, - I am using Italian seasoning along with salt, ground black pepper, chili pepper flakes to flavor the soup. Low sodium vegetable broth is also used. This soup is mild in flavors. But you can spice it up by adding more red pepper powder. You can use other seasonings like onion and garlic powder, old bay seasoning., , - A can of full fat coconut milk brings out velvety creamy texture and smoothness to the soup. You can use regular or other plant based milks as well. I do not use any flour to thicken the soup.

        "Oats Vegetable Soup": "Ingredients: you may use instant oats or steel cut oats. The amount of liquid, spices and the cook time changes with the kind of oats you use., , I use carrots, green beans, sweet corn and green peas here. But tiny cubes of potatoes, sweet potatoes, saut\u00e9ed cauliflower, broccoli and mushrooms go well. Baby spinach, kale and choy sum also go well in this.

I used to add vegetables to my morning oats to increase nutrition and make them more filling, and eventually added stock to reduce calorie density while increasing volume, so it was even more filling and satiating.
