        "German Potato Soup": "Ingredients: the soup is, quick to prepare, , yet it is so satisfyingly creamy and flavorful that you\u2019d never be able to call it \u2018boring.\u2019, , As is always the case, there are several ways to adapt this recipe to your liking and what you have available, too. Depending on what texture you prefer, you can prepare this as chunky potato stew consistency, super smooth and creamy, or even a half-and-half smooth and chunky potato soup (how I like it). Want to add some spice? No problem. Want an even healthier version? I have got tips for that too!, , This recipe works well as a small appetizer, quick and healthy lunch, or hearty evening meal topped with sliced meat-free sausages- change the portion size., , Luckily, as this recipe is also a, great meal-prep option, , it gives you a chance to change it up during the week, so you\u2019ll never get bored. Just because this is an easy soup recipe, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not delightfully delicious!, , , Humble, , Not only is this soup simple to make, but it\u2019s made up largely of low-cost veggies and pantry staples, with several ingredient subs and additions you could make., , The base of this vegetarian potato soup can be made with a very popular traditional German \u2018soup medley\u2019 of vegetables called \u201cSuppengr\u00fcn\u201d (Soup Greens), which consists of carrot, leek, parsley, and celeriac. These vegetables combined make up a delicious base to a vast array of German dishes. So much so that you can even buy pre-made \u2018bundles\u2019 of the veggies in many supermarkets/stores (and often cheaper than purchasing each individually)., , Within this vegan potato soup recipe, I\u2019ve made two tweaks; I\u2019ve left the note that you can use celery rather than celeriac, as I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s easier to get a hold for many/ more familiar to many. If you can get your hands on some celeriac though, then definitely go for it. While the flavor is like celery, it is also root-like and potatoey in ways, with a slightly nutty flavor too \u2013 which works wonderfully when combined with potatoes., , In fact, if you\u2019re not used to cooking with celeriac, you may be surprised to learn that it can be prepared in many of the same ways as potato; mashed, roasted, cubed., , The other tweak I made was to leave leek as optional \u2013 I know, I know, this goes against the whole point of the traditional Suppengr\u00fcn. Honestly, though, I\u2019ve tried this recipe multiple times with and without and find it delicious both ways \u2013 plus you have one less ingredient to deal with! So, I\u2019ll leave the choice up to you., , You can read the rest of my ingredient notes and subs in the, recipe notes, section below., , , ingredient measurements, and nutritional information,, then please read the recipe card below., , Step 1., Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion. Saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes, then add garlic, celery, carrots, potatoes, and all spices. Saut\u00e9 for a further one minute., , Step 2., Pour in the vegetable broth + bay leaves and bring the soup to a boil., , Step 3., Let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes or until the vegetables are softened. Then remove the bay leaves (if used)., , , Step 4., For my preferred texture, pour about half of the soup into a different pot then blend one half with an immersion blender/blender until smooth., , If using a blender then make sure to work in batches and not overfill the blender. You could also blend the entire soup., , Step 5., Pour the blended soup back into the large pot, add the dairy-free cream (or canned coconut milk) and stir to combine. Allow it to simmer for a few more minutes, taste it, and adjust seasonings if necessary. Add more salt/pepper to taste and red pepper flakes for heat., , Serve in bowls, garnish with fresh parsley, and enjoy!, , , How To Serve, , If this vegan potato soup is on the table, then there is always some sort of bread to go along with it. I mean, is there anything better than a spoonful of warm soup, fresh bread, and maybe also some melty vegan butter?, , For this soup, , Gluten-Free Bread, , , Bread Rolls, , or even, Cornbread, would work well!, , In terms of \u2018toppings,\u2019 German potato soup is often served along with bacon or sausages, so feel free to use some vegan bacon or try out my homemade, Vegan Sausage Recipe, . You could also add chives, green onions, or even some lightly toasted slivered almonds., , For a slightly cheesy flavor, then sprinkle over some, Vegan Parmesan Cheese, mix (nooch-based, of course!), , , How To Store, , Any leftovers can be stored in an, airtight container for 3-4 days, . It is also, freezer-friendly for up to 3 months, ., , To thaw simply leave in the fridge overnight and then reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop., , , Recipe Notes, , , The Cream, : You can use any dairy-free cream (soy cream, oat cream, cashew cream, or canned coconut milk). Use plant-based milk for a low-fat version., , Celery:, In Germany, it\u2019s traditional to use celeriac (celery root) and is definitely recommended if you can. However, if you can\u2019t find it, you can use celery stalks (ribs)., , Marjoram:, This is an ingredient I wouldn\u2019t recommend omitting as it really adds a wonderful flavor to this soup. If you don\u2019t have it though, you can add a little thyme and/or rosemary instead., , The Potatoes:, I like to use all-purpose potatoes like Yukon Golds. Floury potatoes (ones you\u2019d use for mash) also work well., , , , Variations, , , Feel free to add leek, to the soup base, for a traditional German potato soup., , Add some broccoli, peas, green asparagus, spinach, kale, or other greens, for a creamy, hearty green potato soup., , To adjust how thick/ thin the soup is, , simply adjust the amount of broth added., , This recipe should be Instant Pot friendly, , , For a cheesier soup, , you can add a little vegan cream cheese in with the cream or even top the soup with a little cheese or vegan Parmesan cheese alternative., , Feel free to experiment with the herbs/spices., Cumin may be a good addition or a little cayenne for heat., , Blend the soup according to your preferred texture., Blend just a small portion for a delicious potato stew, blend half for a creamy, chunky mix, or blend it all for a smooth and creamy version (you will need to add more broth then)., , , , Other Healthy Vegan Soup Recipes:, , , Vegan Tortilla Soup, , Mexican Pinto Bean Soup, , Easy Tomato Pasta Soup, , Vegan Broccoli Cheese Soup, , Easy Veggie Stew With Peas, , Vegan Carrot Ginger Soup, , Vegan Corn Chowder, , , If you give this German Potato soup recipe a try, I\u2019d love a, comment and \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 recipe rating, below.

I followed the recipe pretty exactly (minus the chive garnish) and it turned out great. The recipe doesn\u2019t mention when to add the (optional) turmeric, so I sprinkled a bit in with the broccoli because that\u2019s when I realized I hadn\u2019t used it, but I probably didn\u2019t add enough to make much of an impact.

I modified it slightly while making based on a vegan mac and cheeze I make. I added juice of a half of a lemon, a few dashes of vegan Worcestershire and paprika.

My 11 yr old said it looked like vomit (she\u2019s not completely wrong) but it tasted good. I left out the nutritional yeast because she\u2019s sensitive to it. I halved this recipe and it still made 6 servings. If I have golden potatoes on hand sometime, I may try this again and see if I can get a better color., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , florentina, , says:, , , , February 9, 2022 at 7:50 pm, , , , , Hey Abby, to achieve that pretty golden color you really want to use the Yukon gold potatoes in this soup and also add a little pinch of turmeric. If you used Russets you must peel them first but they still won\u2019t yield that nice golden soup., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Lindsay, , says:, , , , March 2, 2022 at 6:50 am, , , , , Delicious!

I had to make a substitution for the cashews since my daughter has a severe cashew allergy. So I used unsweetened Milkadamia (Macadamia Milk) in place of them. Everything else I followed pretty much exactly. Because I didn\u2019t have to puree the cashews, I was able to use an immersion blender instead and the consistency of the soup was perfect. I pan fried some vegan bacon, crumbled it up and put that on top and yum yum!! I brought leftovers into work with me for lunch, and here I am at 10:30am sneaking bites of it! LOL.

I still wasn\u2019t feeling it was really good and flavorful so I tried it over some freshly made jasmine rice and it was fabulous!!  Thank you! Can I freeze it with the broccoli already in it?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , florentina, , says:, , , , December 5, 2022 at 5:29 pm, , , , , Hi Alisa! The nutritional yeast is a major flavor component of this recipe, it\u2019s where the umami cheesiness comes from. If anything I\u2019d suggest adding even more, not less. The important thing is to use a non-fortified organic nutritional yeast, the fortified ones have added synthetic vitamins which could explain your past experience with it. I\u2019m glad it all turned out well in the end and you enjoyed the soup \ud83d\ude42 ~ Florentina Xo\u2019s, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Sara, , says:, , , , March 4, 2023 at 3:48 am, , , , , , , , My goodness is this soup good!

Reminiscent of broccoli cheese but so much better. My (omni) husband loved it as well. We ate it with fresh baked corn bread., I did find it needed extra S&P.

I used less garlic and no nutritional yeast, and it was perfect for my tastes. I had broccoli from my garden, and this was a wonderful way to use it.

Do you have an adaptation for a crockpot?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , florentina, , says:, , , , January 25, 2025 at 7:50 pm, , , , , Hi Cat Instructions: Preheat a heavy stock up over medium low heat and saut\u00e9 the onion in a splash of water (or a drizzle of olive oil) until translucent., Add the sea salt, pepper flakes, celery and carrots and give everything a nice toss. Cover with a lid and sweat a few more minutes until the carrots begin to soften., Add the garlic, potatoes, cashews and vegetable stock and bring everything to a simmer. Stir in the nutritional yeast, cover with a lid and cook 20 minutes or until the potatoes and cashews have softened., Transfer the soup to a powerful mixer and carefully pur\u00e9e until silky smooth. ( the Vitamix did an exponentially better job at this than my immersion blender)., Transfer the creamy soup back to the pot and bring to a simmer again. Add the broccoli florets, cover with a lid and cook a few more minutes until the broccoli is softened to your liking. Take good care not to overcook it, 3 to 5 minutes should yield that perfect al dente texture.\u00a0Alternatively you can steam the broccoli separately while your soup is cooking., Taste and adjust seasoning with the sea salt., Add more vegetable stock at this point to thin out the soup if you prefer., Serve hot with extra red pepper flakes and the fresh chives., , Video, , , , , , , , , , Notes, , After experimenting a few times with this soup I came to the conclusion that there is no need to soak the cashews in advance. By boiling them in the soup they will become soft and easy to blend in a powerful blender., , I adapted the original recipe to yield a larger batch as the only complaint about this soup has been that the portions were too small and people didn't have any leftovers.

        "German Vegan Potato Soup": "Ingredients: the soup is, quick to prepare, , yet it is so satisfyingly creamy and flavorful that you\u2019d never be able to call it \u2018boring.\u2019, , As is always the case, there are several ways to adapt this recipe to your liking and what you have available, too. Depending on what texture you prefer, you can prepare this as chunky potato stew consistency, super smooth and creamy, or even a half-and-half smooth and chunky potato soup (how I like it). Want to add some spice? No problem. Want an even healthier version? I have got tips for that too!, , This recipe works well as a small appetizer, quick and healthy lunch, or hearty evening meal topped with sliced meat-free sausages- change the portion size., , Luckily, as this recipe is also a, great meal-prep option, , it gives you a chance to change it up during the week, so you\u2019ll never get bored. Just because this is an easy soup recipe, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not delightfully delicious!, , , Humble, , Not only is this soup simple to make, but it\u2019s made up largely of low-cost veggies and pantry staples, with several ingredient subs and additions you could make., , The base of this vegetarian potato soup can be made with a very popular traditional German \u2018soup medley\u2019 of vegetables called \u201cSuppengr\u00fcn\u201d (Soup Greens), which consists of carrot, leek, parsley, and celeriac. These vegetables combined make up a delicious base to a vast array of German dishes. So much so that you can even buy pre-made \u2018bundles\u2019 of the veggies in many supermarkets/stores (and often cheaper than purchasing each individually)., , Within this vegan potato soup recipe, I\u2019ve made two tweaks; I\u2019ve left the note that you can use celery rather than celeriac, as I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s easier to get a hold for many/ more familiar to many. If you can get your hands on some celeriac though, then definitely go for it. While the flavor is like celery, it is also root-like and potatoey in ways, with a slightly nutty flavor too \u2013 which works wonderfully when combined with potatoes., , In fact, if you\u2019re not used to cooking with celeriac, you may be surprised to learn that it can be prepared in many of the same ways as potato; mashed, roasted, cubed., , The other tweak I made was to leave leek as optional \u2013 I know, I know, this goes against the whole point of the traditional Suppengr\u00fcn. Honestly, though, I\u2019ve tried this recipe multiple times with and without and find it delicious both ways \u2013 plus you have one less ingredient to deal with! So, I\u2019ll leave the choice up to you., , You can read the rest of my ingredient notes and subs in the, recipe notes, section below., , , ingredient measurements, and nutritional information,, then please read the recipe card below., , Step 1., Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion. Saut\u00e9 for 3 minutes, then add garlic, celery, carrots, potatoes, and all spices. Saut\u00e9 for a further one minute., , Step 2., Pour in the vegetable broth + bay leaves and bring the soup to a boil., , Step 3., Let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes or until the vegetables are softened. Then remove the bay leaves (if used)., , , Step 4., For my preferred texture, pour about half of the soup into a different pot then blend one half with an immersion blender/blender until smooth., , If using a blender then make sure to work in batches and not overfill the blender. You could also blend the entire soup., , Step 5., Pour the blended soup back into the large pot, add the dairy-free cream (or canned coconut milk) and stir to combine. Allow it to simmer for a few more minutes, taste it, and adjust seasonings if necessary. Add more salt/pepper to taste and red pepper flakes for heat., , Serve in bowls, garnish with fresh parsley, and enjoy!, , , How To Serve, , If this vegan potato soup is on the table, then there is always some sort of bread to go along with it. I mean, is there anything better than a spoonful of warm soup, fresh bread, and maybe also some melty vegan butter?, , For this soup, , Gluten-Free Bread, , , Bread Rolls, , or even, Cornbread, would work well!, , In terms of \u2018toppings,\u2019 German potato soup is often served along with bacon or sausages, so feel free to use some vegan bacon or try out my homemade, Vegan Sausage Recipe, . You could also add chives, green onions, or even some lightly toasted slivered almonds., , For a slightly cheesy flavor, then sprinkle over some, Vegan Parmesan Cheese, mix (nooch-based, of course!), , , How To Store, , Any leftovers can be stored in an, airtight container for 3-4 days, . It is also, freezer-friendly for up to 3 months, ., , To thaw simply leave in the fridge overnight and then reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop., , , Recipe Notes, , , The Cream, : You can use any dairy-free cream (soy cream, oat cream, cashew cream, or canned coconut milk). Use plant-based milk for a low-fat version., , Celery:, In Germany, it\u2019s traditional to use celeriac (celery root) and is definitely recommended if you can. However, if you can\u2019t find it, you can use celery stalks (ribs)., , Marjoram:, This is an ingredient I wouldn\u2019t recommend omitting as it really adds a wonderful flavor to this soup. If you don\u2019t have it though, you can add a little thyme and/or rosemary instead., , The Potatoes:, I like to use all-purpose potatoes like Yukon Golds. Floury potatoes (ones you\u2019d use for mash) also work well., , , , Variations, , , Feel free to add leek, to the soup base, for a traditional German potato soup., , Add some broccoli, peas, green asparagus, spinach, kale, or other greens, for a creamy, hearty green potato soup., , To adjust how thick/ thin the soup is, , simply adjust the amount of broth added., , This recipe should be Instant Pot friendly, , , For a cheesier soup, , you can add a little vegan cream cheese in with the cream or even top the soup with a little cheese or vegan Parmesan cheese alternative., , Feel free to experiment with the herbs/spices., Cumin may be a good addition or a little cayenne for heat., , Blend the soup according to your preferred texture., Blend just a small portion for a delicious potato stew, blend half for a creamy, chunky mix, or blend it all for a smooth and creamy version (you will need to add more broth then)., , , , Other Healthy Vegan Soup Recipes:, , , Vegan Tortilla Soup, , Mexican Pinto Bean Soup, , Easy Tomato Pasta Soup, , Vegan Broccoli Cheese Soup, , Easy Veggie Stew With Peas, , Vegan Carrot Ginger Soup, , Vegan Corn Chowder, , , If you give this German Potato soup recipe a try, I\u2019d love a, comment and \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 recipe rating, below.
