        "Healthy Quinoa Salad": "Ingredients: mango, red bell peppers, and fresh herbs from the produce aisle then stacked with organic beans for added protein., , Quinoa salads like this one are a favorite healthy side dish that can easily slide into the all-in-one plant-based meal category too. They\u2019re fast to make but last all week in the refrigerator, making them a meal-prepper\u2019s dream for lunch, dinner, or as a quick, satisfying snack., , , What This Healthy Quinoa Salad is Made of, , Adding fresh veggies and fruit to the diet are essential to healthy living. Luckily, , Kroger\u2019s, abundance of organic and sustainably produced fruits and vegetables in their produce aisles make it easy and economical to add to every meal or grab as a snack on their own., , This salad combines some favorite fresh produce with a few of my go-to, Simple Truth Organic, pantry items to make a side dish salad that works all year long, no matter what the season., , , Simple Truth Organic quinoa, , Red bell pepper, , Red onion, , Cilantro, , Mint, , Mango, , Avocado, , Simple Truth Organic black beans, , Simple Truth Organic garbanzo beans, , Lime, , Jalapeno, , Canola oil, , Champagne vinegar, , Chili powder, , , , Beans, Beans, The Magical Fruit, , Black beans and garbanzo beans (aka chickpeas) not only add flavor and bite to this salad, but are a good source of vegetarian protein too. Using, Simple Truth organic canned beans, saves time and convenience (no soaking required) and are sustainably grown and harvested for better piece of mind., , White cannellini beans, pinto beans, and Great Northern beans are good choices too., , Is Quinoa Salad Healthy?, , Known as one of nature\u2019s superfoods, quinoa (KEEN-wah) is a carbohydrate that\u2019s extra rich in protein, dietary fiber, B vitamins, and dietary minerals. In fact, 1 cup of quinoa provides twice the protein plus about 5 grams more fiber than the same amount of cooked white rice, making it a favorite plant-based protein for vegetarians and vegans. As a combo carb/protein, it fills you up faster and sticks with you longer., , Quinoa is easy to cook, and flavor neutral so it melds in nicely with just about anything you add it to, making it a perfect base for this easy to make salad. Use, Simple Truth Organic white or red quinoa,, or a combination of both., , , How to Cook Quinoa, , Conventional teachings instruct the home cook to prepare quinoa the same as rice, in portions set to a formulaic ratio that\u2019s brought to a boil, then covered and simmered until done. Personally, I rarely find success cooking it that way and end up adding more water as it cooks, and more water, sometimes ending in a gummy mess., , Instead, , I follow the idea of cooking quinoa just like pasta, , in a pot of water at a rolling boil, checking for doneness and those little quinoa finally emerge and the quinoa is a tender bite. Then, I use a fine mesh strainer to drain. If serving warm, fluff with a fork and cover the pot with a dish towel and top with a lid to absorb some of the excess moisture as it keeps warm. If eating the quinoa at room temperature, spread the quinoa on a plate or a baking sheet to cool and dry so it doesn\u2019t get clumpy and gummy., , Quinoa is often sold pre-washed but if you\u2019re not sure, it\u2019s safest to rinse and drain it in a colander before cooking to remove it\u2019s natural coating as it can taste bitter., , 1 cup of dried quinoa typically yields about 3 cups of cooked quinoa., , , Tips for Making This Healthy Quinoa Salad, , All this salad requires is a smidgen of cooking, a bit of chopping, and a little stirring., , , Cut the vegetables and fruits into similar bite-size pieces, , making it easy to get more flavors in each forkful., , Be sure to use cool quinoa before adding your raw vegetables., If you favor a nuttier flavor, toast the quinoa before boiling it. To toast the quinoa, add it to a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Then, cook the quinoa as directed., , Give your mango and avocado time to ripen, by purchasing them 1-2 days before making this salad., , Rinse and drain the beans, before adding them to the salad., , Gently toss the salad, after dressing it so the avocado doesn\u2019t turn into mush., , , , Quinoa Salad Dressing, , Don\u2019t be alarmed by the amount of dressing called for in this salad. Quinoa is absorbent, and the dressing is where each of the grains gets its flavor., , This salad dressing calls for two types of acid:, fresh squeezed lime juice and champagne vinegar. Using two different acids mellows the other out, avoiding that puckery bite. Feel free to use a similar mellow vinegar such as rice wine or red wine vinegar instead., , Use a neutral oil., Because it\u2019s flavorless, I prefer canola oil in salad like this but feel free to use olive oil if its what you have., , Choose your sweetener., Because it dissolved easily, I use regular old sugar in my dressing but honey works well too. Be sure to taste for sweetness and add more of one or the other as needed., , For a balanced flavor flair,, I used chili powder to add an earthy note to the dressing. You could also try cumin or allspice if you prefer., , , What to Serve With Quinoa Salad, , If you\u2019re craving another layer of clean protein to make this an even more robust meal, feel free to add any of the following:, , , Fried or Baked Tofu, , Grilled Shrimp, , Marinated Greek Chicken, or, Cilantro Lime Grilled Chicken, , 10-Minute Maple-Crusted Salmon, , Classic Gazpacho, , , If you mak, e this recipe, please let me know!
