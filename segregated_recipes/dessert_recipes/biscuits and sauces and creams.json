        "Vegan Oreos": "Ingredients: , , My first concern when I\u00a0got this recipe request was crispy cookie?\u2026.how to make a crispy crumbly oil-free cookie? We can\u2019t have soft chewy vegan oreos, then they\u2019d just be whoopee pies pretending., , Based on, these oatmeal cookies, , I knew, maple syrup, had to be involved. And of course, cacao powder, is an integral ingredient too because chocolate. So from there, using my Magic School Bus knowledge, brown rice flour, . Yep, , , Filling your Vegan Oreos, , There\u2019s no better creamy white filling then, coconut cream., However, since I know many of you are high carb vegans, I wanted to include some\u00a0lower fat options for the filling as well\u2026, , \u2013, Powdered peanut butter., It sounds like a higher fat option, but with powdered peanut butter\u00a0it\u2019s actually a lower fat way to go!, \u2013, Chocolate peanut butter., Utilize the thickening action of powdered peanut butter to make a chocolate filling. Powdered peanut butter + cacao powder + water., \u2013, Banana., If you size your cookies just right, then one banana coin will\u00a0sandwich in between two cookies perfectly.

In my case, I just got a bit disgusted by the thought of it. Try seasoning meat alternatives with the same spices as you used to season your meat, because plain meat isn\u2019t what you like. Also don\u2019t trap yourself in this mindset. Most vegans used to love meat and cheese. We eat them for so long we become accustomed. Also make sure you reward yourself for eating consciously and sacrificing something you like for the greater good of everything. Ask yourself if you love meat or animals more, maybe. Just make sure you always remember your reasons for going vegan. Try to associate living animals with meat in your mind. That way there will never be disconnect, and you won\u2019t fall under a sick illusion., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Evelyn, , says, , , October 14, 2018 at 5:28 pm, , , , There is a documentary on YouTube called \u201cDominion\u201d.

My integrative/functional MD ordered one (which is covered by my insurance since a Medical Doctor ordered it \u2013 you will pay for most testing ordered by non-MD\u2019s out of pocket even if it is covered) and I\u2019m super excited because I\u2019ve been having major problems gaining muscle!

Double recipe love <3, You know what I always hated about them though was that they cracked and crumbled so you could not just bite in.. You HAD to remove one cookie to eat it effectively which I guess was the point!, OOO do you remember those 200 cal packs of :oreo thins\" those were so gross! It was like a stale chocolate disc of sadness speckled with a few white dots of who knows what!, But I did always weirdly like the mini oreos (not the 100 cal ones) but the small bite sized ones that were always all destroyed in the package and seemed to be given out at school, parties, or Halloween. For some reason I thought they tasted best!, Okay\u2026sorry for this novel of a comment \ud83d\ude09 xoxoxo, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Natalie, , says, , , March 11, 2016 at 8:16 pm, , , , Who else posted oreos, I\u2019d love to check them out? I never took my oreos apart actually, always a biter! The secret to the clean crumbly cookie bite is to suck in a little bit as you bite so you can not drop any crumbs! Try it next time, it works. And I LOVED the oreo thins!!! Those were my favorite, I actually think I liked them better than actual oreos. I have no clue what the white stuff was either, probably just sugar, but those were the bomb haha! Not sad to me!

I love that you used brown rice flour, that is the exact flour I used in my classic chocolate chip cookies to get that crispy exterior as well, my exact reasoning, so I know these would be crispy too, YUM YUM. And oreos have to be crispy! These would be great with the peanut butter or heck, even a chocolate ganache, you know for major chocoholics like myself, lol! Oooh that\u2019s giving me ideas. I\u2019m not really a fan of coconut cream because of the strong coconut flavor, so I love that you added a peanut butter option.

I ate them in my school lunch mostly so that was good portion control since my mom only sent 2 haha! The brown rice flour is perfect for crispy things! I knew oat wouldn\u2019t work and BR was the only other one I had on hand when I was making these at like 8pm at night, but logically it makes sense. There are lots of times when I hate brown rice flour in breads and things, but here it\u2019s perfect. I wish they would stay crispy though, have you noticed that. The maple syrup thing works, but after a couple of days they are soft \ud83d\ude41 Kinda like tiny whoopee pies, so still good but not as oreo perfect. GANACHE!!!

Sometimes I\u2019m \u201cbad\u201d and use regular (like Jif) peanut butter- it\u2019s definitely not as good for me as natural pb is, but it\u2019s cheaper and (not going to lie) yummier, especially straight out of the jar!, That\u2019s so cute that your mom put 2 Oreos in your lunch! My mom always put a piece of candy or something in mine (never Oreos though! I had to go to a friend\u2019s house to get Oreos \ud83d\ude41 ).

Perhaps it\u2019s just because I was raised on Peter Pan lol! I always loved homemade baked things in my lunch box better too!

More like NoNo\u2019s!, It\u2019s crazy what we eat when we don\u2019t realize what is in our food or where it comes from- and how much better natural food tastes than unnatural (aka super processed) food once we know the difference!, Yes my feet seriously are orange!! I eat like a bag of baby carrots a day or 3-5 big carrots. I can\u2019t help it- they pair well with lots of different foods (hummus, peanut butter, guacamole, salsa, salad,etc.) and they taste good! \ud83d\ude00, Have a great weekend, Natalie!

Truth be told I\u201dm actually kinda scared of homemade nut butter making. I\u2019ve done it a couple times and it always feels like I\u2019m about to break my food processor or blender, so I just buy it. There are so many options out there that I\u2019m cool with letting someone else do the grinding \ud83d\ude00 But freshly ground almond butter with raw almonds is probably my favorite nut butter. I love raw almonds because they are a little bit sweeter, mmmm <3 Although peanut butter is a very very close second. And carrots are the perfect snacking vegetable! With hummus to dip them in one bag is nothing. Guacamole--that's a good idea I've never tried that!

You had the right idea, more brown rice flour or less maple syrup until you get a rollable consistency. You can also spoon it onto a pan and spread it if it\u2019s too thin, but just thickening it is probably better. Also you can use a little water on your hands instead of coconut oil, I use that a lot with sticky doughs. It will just evaporate as they bake and works quite well.

Not sure they would really be firm though. I imagine a date-based raw cookie would be better. Date based raw cookies when frozen get a really nice texture but since dates don\u2019t really freeze they still stay bite-able.

I eventually added 60g of water and it still didn\u2019t form into a dough. I melted 50g of coconut butter and added that to see if it would bind together. It was still a little dry so I added 20 additional grams of water. I was able to form it into a ball of dough but when attempting to work with it the dough would crumble easily. I\u2019ve left it in the fridge to settle overnight. Any suggestions as to why it wouldn\u2019t have worked with the initial recipe? Thanks., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Natalie, , says, , , June 13, 2017 at 8:39 pm, , , , Hi Sam! The recipe calls for brown rice flour, not white, and I think that is the issue.

I know that is an annoying answer, but in many recipes swapping the liquid sweetener will be just fine but in others the maple syrup really is best for acheieving a crispy crunchy texture. Like these Oreos for instance, since they are oil free I am using the maple syrup to make them snappy and crisp which molasses will not do as good a job of. You can still try it but the texture will most likely be much chewier. The taste is different as well, but it\u2019s mostly about texture.

I would suggest going with this recipe instead and subbing 1/3 of the flour for cacao/cocoa powder:, https://www.feastingonfruit.com/homemade-vegan-golden-oreos/, .

Since maple syrup is the only liquid ingredient in this recipe, it really won\u2019t work without it. And if you added water or non-dairy milk it would make the cookie much chewier unfortunately. Sorry! Other liquid sweeteners would work like honey or agave if you have either of those on hand., , Or if you wanted to adapt this recipe (, https://www.feastingonfruit.com/homemade-vegan-golden-oreos/, ) to be chocolate you could try replacing the maple syrup with more coconut butter, adding brown/cane sugar (about 1/3 cup) and replacing 1/2 cup of the flour with cacao powder.

I just came across your recipe linked to the PETA website. I was looking for easy vegan cookie recipes to make with my son (he\u2019s 3.5 and very into baking). This week we have tried 2 recipes, but not very so successful so far. I want to give yours a try! I was wondering if almond flour would work instead of brown rice flour. Also, could I use agave instead of maple syrup? Thank you in advance for your answer and Happy New Year!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Natalie, , says, , , January 1, 2018 at 6:25 pm, , , , Hi Rose! Sorry to hear you guys haven\u2019t had any cookie luck yet. Agave will be just fine instead of maple syrup, and almond flour will work but the amount will be quite different as it is much more naturally moist so it\u2019s not a 1-for-1 sub unfortunately. A better idea would be to just try this recipe instead:, https://www.feastingonfruit.com/almond-flour-sugar-cookies/, and replace 1/3-1/2 cup of the flour with cocoa powder.

Let the sugar dissolve, gently swirling the pot but not stirring, until mixture turns a deep golden color, 8 to 9 minutes., Immediately remove pot from heat and pour caramel into ramekins. Gently lift and tilt ramekins to coat the inside with caramel. Set aside., Combine coconut milk and agar agar in a medium sauce pot., In the blender combine the oatmilk, sugar, chickpea flour, and vanilla. Process until smooth. Pour this mixture into the pot with the coconut milk., Bring mixture to a simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat. Let cool slightly, then pour into ramekins., Place ramekins in the fridge for 4 hours to let the flan set., To serve, place bottom of ramekin in a container with hot water for 1 -2 minutes, in order to release the flan., Use a small knife or offset spatula to carefully loosen the edges of the flan. Turn flan over onto a plate, shake gently to release flan and remove ramekin., , Video, , Notes, , If you don\u2019t have access to agar-agar you can use 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp. of cornstarch instead. Dissolve the cornstarch in the oat milk, and then proceed to add it to the blender with the sugar, vanilla, and chickpea flour. Then add to the coconut milk mixture on the stove and simmer for 5 min., , If you would like this flan to be yellow in color you can add a couple drops of yellow food coloring., , If you want to make a very jiggly and delicate version of this flan (like cr\u00e8me caramel) simply reduce the amount of agar-agar to 1 tsp., , , , , Nutrition, Serving:, 1, flan, |, Calories:, 292, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 42, g, |, Protein:, 2, g, |, Fat:, 14, g, |, Saturated Fat:, 12, g, |, Sodium:, 28, mg, |, Potassium:, 167, mg, |, Fiber:, 1, g, |, Sugar:, 39, g, |, Vitamin A:, 82, IU, |, Vitamin C:, 1, mg, |, Calcium:, 69, mg, |, Iron:, 2, mg, , , , , Tried this recipe?, Mention, @dorastable, or tag, #mexicangonevegan, !, , , , , , , , Dora R., , , Dora is the founder, recipe developer, and photographer at Dora's Table and Mi Mero Mole.

        "Vegan Date caramel": "Ingredients: super sweet and highly addictive caramel sauce. It's a very simple recipe done within 15 minutes. You can spoon/pour it over just about anything without feeling like you are overindulging. SO good!, , , There are so many vegan caramel sauces on the web, but lots of them are made using vegan butter, vegan cream and granulated sugar. These amazing gooey vegan caramel sauces are perfect for the occasional special moments.  But, don't you feel like we should be able to enjoy caramel sauces at any time without feeling like we are spoiling a good healthy eating day? A caramel sauce that you would generously pour over your children's morning oatmeal bowls without any guilt?, , I got you covered., , maple syrup, vegan milk and a hint of coconut oil. It will NOT give you the exact classic caramel-y texture that stretches and pours like a thin sauce. BUT, its flavor and smooth sticky texture is SO darn delicious. You won't be able to resist eating it by the spoon!, , And it is very straight forward to prepare. After you soak the dates, then you only have to blend everything together. Easy peasy. Play around with the amount of vegan milk to reach a desired consistency and use this caramel sauce in anything you want to add a caramel-y flavor!, , (psst. if looking for a delicious layered caramel dessert, then check out this, vegan millionaire shortbread, !), , , Why you will love this vegan caramel sauce, , , Rich flavor, , Sticky, thick and super smooth texture, , Extra sweet, thanks to the medjool dates, , Easy, quick and simple recipe, , No cooking required!, , A healthier option compared to regular caramel sauces, , , How to make this vegan caramel sauce, , , Soak the pitted dates in plenty of boiling water for 10 minutes. Drain., , Then, blend the softened dates, maple syrup, coconut oil and vegan milk until smooth., , Et voil\u00e0!, , , , Watch how to make it, , , Tips when making a date caramel sauce, , , The type and freshness of your dates will largely influence the result of your caramel. You want to choose large, moist, soft and fresh medjool dates. The small-ish, dried out and old dates that have been hanging out in your pantry for a while might not be the best choice when making this caramel sauce. You are looking for plump dates that will create a rich flavor and texture. You can find, medjool dates, in the produce section at your grocery stores., , When blending the sauce, take a few breaks to scrape the walls. You might have to do this for a few times. Even after soaking your dates and using a high speed blender, dates can take some time to be crushed into a luscious sauce., , You can adjust the texture of your sauce with more vegan milk if desired, especially if looking for a more pourable sauce. Using more milk will make your sauce not as sweet, which you could adjust by adding an extra tablespoon or so of maple syrup., , , Recipe variation, , I keep this recipe simple as I find its flavor so rich and delicious just as it is. But, you can also:, , , Add a hint of vanilla extract to enhance even more the sweetness., , Use canned coconut milk (mix well before using) instead of regular vegan milk. This will add more fat to the recipe, but also more richness and creaminess., , If you love the salt and sweet flavor combo, then add a pinch of sea salt., , , , How to use this vegan caramel sauce, , The question should be more how, not, to use this decadent delicious sauce! Here are my favorite usages:, , , Morning oatmeal or, vegan overnight oats, , Generously spread over toast or this, vegan apple cinnamon bread, , As a dipping sauce for fruits (perfect for apples), , Over vegan ice cream or when making, caramel ice cream cups, , To top cakes, cupcakes, , healthy black bean brownies, , , vegan banana muffins, , Or, for bad-days-binge-eating by the spoon. You do you, we are not watching., , , Storage, , Keep the date caramel sauce in a airtight container for 1-2 weeks in your fridge. Stir before using. The caramel might appear thicker as it cools down., , It can also be frozen for up to 3 months., , , Other sweet dessert sauces/toppings you might like, , , Cherry marmalade, , Coconut whipped cream, , Healthy peanut butter frosting, , Vegan cashew vanilla icing, , Tahini caramel sauce, , Vegan fruit dip, , , I hope you enjoy this vegan caramel sauce recipe as much as we do!
