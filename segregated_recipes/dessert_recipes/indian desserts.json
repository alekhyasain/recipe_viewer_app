You will find this served even in buffets, Thali and almost at every feast because it is the Ultimate winner and is the best!, , Gulab Jamun, , , Jalebi,, Rasgulla, &, Kaju katli, are some of the other popular Sweets from Indian cuisine., , About Carrot Halwa, , This classic dessert gets its name \u201cGajar Halwa\u201d since carrots are known as \u201cGajar\u201d in Hindi and Halwa is a pudding like dessert from the Indian Sub-Continent. So gajar halwa is nothing but Indian carrot pudding., , But it\u2019s not the pudding you are probably thinking of ! This neither has an egg nor a thickening agent/ ingredient. Slow cooking the carrots with milk until all of the liquid evaporates, imparts a magical flavor and lovely pudding like texture to the dish., , In India, a special kind of carrots known as Delhi gajar is widely available during the winters. A lot of people especially in the North make carrot halwa with Delhi carrots since these have a sweeter flavor and are much more juicer than the other kinds. However, you can use the regular carrots the same way in my recipe., , , Traditional carrot halwa is made by slow cooking fine grated carrots with full fat milk which is easy to make but takes some time as all of the moisture and liquid from carrots, milk and sugar has to evaporate and then thicken the halwa., , , , , Carrot halwa with condensed milk under 15 mins., , Gajar halwa with khoya \u2013 Make this during festive season when you have surplus khoya/ mawa to use up., , Gajar ka halwa with milk powder \u2013 Make this when you are short of milk or want to use up surplus milk powder., , , More, Halwa recipes, Rava kesari, , Moong dal halwa, Badam halwa, Lauki ka halwa, , , , Photo Guide, , , How to Make Carrot Halwa (Stepwise Photos), , Preparation, , 1. Wash 500 grams carrots (half kg or 1.1 lbs) thoroughly under running water. A little more or less is fine to use, not a lot. Peel and fine grate them. A food processor quickens the process of grating. So if you own one, you can use it., , Make sure you use a heavy bottom large pot or pan for this recipe as it helps to prevent the halwa from sticking to the bottom and burning. However a pressure cooker too works well., , If you do not have cardamom powder, crush 4 green cardamoms in a mortar pestle or a spice jar., , 2. On a low heat, roast 10 pistachios, 5 to 6 almonds and 5 cashew nuts until crunchy. Remove them to a chopping board, cool and chop them. OR Alternately chop the nuts first or carefully pulse them in a grinder (only twice or thrice). Fry them in one tablespoon ghee until golden and crunchy. Set aside. If you prefer to use raisins, you may fry about 15 raisins in ghee until plump. Set aside., , , , 3. Next to the same pan, pour 2 cups milk and begin to heat it., , , , Simmer Carrots with Milk, , 4. Add grated carrots. (Optional \u2013 If using regular carrots and not (Delhi gajar) red carrots then you can saute the carrots in 1 tablespoon ghee until a nice aroma comes out then pour milk. This step helps to get rid of the earthy and strong flavor of some kinds of carrots.)(check video for details)., , , , 5. Stir and cook on a medium flame. Keep stirring to prevent burning at the bottom. Since I used a heavy bottom pan, I didn\u2019t have to stir very often. But I suggest consistently keep checking otherwise the halwa will stick at the bottom., , , , 6. You will have be cautious always towards the end. Especially when the milk has almost evaporated., , , , 7. Cook until the milk completely evaporates., , , , 8. Next add half cup + 2 tablespoons sugar and stir., , , , 9. Sugar melts and carrot halwa turns gooey once again. Stir and cook. When the moisture is half evaporated, add 1 tablespoon ghee and stir well., , , , 10. Stir and cook until the halwa thickens. Just before you finish off, add half teaspoon cardamom powder., , , , Finally garnish carrot halwa with nuts & raisins. Serve chilled or warm., , , , , , , Photo Guide, , Gajar Ka Halwa with Condensed Milk, , flavorful and delicious., To make this, you can use Delhi gajar or the regular carrots. When I made this I used the regular carrots as Delhi gajar is seasonal and is not available in Singapore throughout the year., , , 1.Wash and peel young 500 grams carrots well. Grate them either using a food processor or hand grater. Use the fine grater if you have a food processer., , 2. Add \u00bd tablespoon ghee and heat the pan. This prevents the halwa from sticking to the pan & burning. If you want to you can add the \u00bc cup chopped nuts. Fry them until lightly golden. Then add 2 tablespoons raisins. When they become plump, remove to a plate., , , , 3. Add grated carrots & saute for 2 to 3 mins., , , , 4. Pour \u00bd tin condensed milk (\u00bd cup + 2 tablespoons)., , , , 5.

Then add carrots and milk. Cook on a low heat stirring well until carrot turns tender. If the milk evaporates and the carrot are not soft then cover and cook on a lowest heat for few minutes., , Then add khoya and sugar. Mix and continue to cook. The entire mixture turns gooey. Let it cook until gajar ka halwa thickens., , Add 1 tablespoon ghee and saute for 2 mins. Turn off and garnish with nuts and raisins., , , , , Photo Guide, , Gajar ka Halwa with Milk Powder, , Milk powder is also known as dry milk and is sold in the grocery stores. I use Nestle everyday for this. Depending on the kind you use, adjust the quantity of sugar and milk powder to suit your taste., , , , Add grated carrots to a heavy bottom pot or pressure cooker and pour milk. Cook on a medium to low heat until carrots become tender. If using a pressure cooker, pressure cook for 1 whistle on a medium heat. Let the pressure drop naturally., , Stir the carrots as they cook until tender. Then add sugar and continue to cook on a low heat. Sugar melts and carrot halwa becomes slightly gooey. At stage sprinkle milk powder all over and mix well to incorporate the milk powder., , Stir and continue to cook until most of the moisture if evaporated. Taste test and add more milk powder or sugar to adjust the sweetness levels., , Add cardamom powder and turn off the heat. Serve with chopped nuts., , , Instant pot Carrot Halwa, , , , Pro Tips, , Choosing carrots:, Always use fresh, tender and young carrots that are less fibrous. If needed taste them before cooking. Carrots that are too old or mature are more fibrous & have a different flavour & texture which do not go well for the halwa. Young carrots are sweeter in flavour & yield a mouth melting carrot halwa., , Milk:, Use full fat a.k.a whole milk to get a tasty carrot halwa. For a low fat version just reduce the amount of milk in the recipe or use low fat milk. You can also skip or reduce the amount of ghee. If you are a vegan you can make this halwa with coconut or almond milk. You can also use homemade almond milk following my faq section below., , Grating carrots:, Grate the carrots with a hand held grater or food processor. I always use a food processor. You can grate to thick or thin shreds depending on how you like your carrot halwa to be. My kids like them to be very fine as the halwa just melts off in the mouth. But for this post I have used larger gratings., , Saut\u00e9ing carrots:, My mom makes this by first saut\u00e9ing the grated carrot in ghee for 5 mins. Then pours the milk. However I do not do this just to save time. Adding ghee at a later time, once the halwa is cooked gives a more intense flavour. So you can do either ways., , Cooking:, Be cautious & do not leave the carrot halwa on the stove unattended as the milk will get scorched and burnt. You will need to constantly stir the gajar halwa as it cooks through., , Faqs, , How to make vegan halwa?, , Soak 20 to 25 almonds or cashews overnight. Peel them and blend to a super smooth paste with \u00bd cup water. Pour 1 \u00bd cups more water and blend. Use this in place of regular milk in the recipe. Also skip ghee or replace it with flavourless virgin coconut oil., , , How long can you store carrot halwa?, , Carrot halwa made with traditional way can be refrigerated for upto 3 to 4 days after which the taste begins to deteriorate. So to store it longer for about 3 to 4 weeks freeze it., , , What is the way to best store carrot halwa?, , Cool it immediately after cooking and transfer to an air tight glass container. Either refrigerate or freeze it. Make sure you use freezer safe container if freezing., , , What is the best way to reheat halwa?, , Reheat it directly on the stovetop on a low heat stirring often or in the microwave stirring every 30 seconds. You can also reheat it in the Instant pot on a high pressure for 0 to 2 mins depending on the quantity of halwa., , , , , Related Recipes, , Diwali Sweets Rec..., , , Moong Dal Halwa R..., , , Kaju Katli Recipe..., , , Sheera Recipe | S..., , , Rava Kesari Recip..., , , Badam halwa recip..., , , , Recipe Card, , , , , , Carrot Halwa Recipe | Gajar ka Halwa, , , 5, from, 481, votes, , , , Gajar Ka Halwa is a classic sweet dish from Indian cuisine made with Carrots (Gajar), sugar, , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , Print Recipe, , Pin Recipe, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , For best results follow the step-by-step photos above the recipe card, , , , , , Prep Time, 10, minutes, , minutes, Cook Time, 30, minutes, , minutes, Total Time, 40, minutes, , minutes, , Servings, 4, , people, , Author, Swasthi, , , , Preparation, \u25a2, Wash carrots under running water & peel them., \u25a2, Grate them in a food processor or with a hand grater., \u25a2, Dry roast nuts on a low heat until crunchy, cool & chop them., OR, Alternately chop the nuts first & fry them in 1 tbsp ghee until slightly golden.\u00a0Then add raisins & fry until they plump up.

But avoid this if using Delhi Carrots., , To add protein to the recipe & fasten the cooking, you may add 4 tablespoons of almond flour right at the beginning. This helps to thicken your halwa faster.

Saute shredded carrots in 1 tablespoon ghee for 6 to 7 minutes, cool completely before freezing in glass containers. I have done this twice and it was good for 3 to 4 months.

Whenever there would be a celebration or a festival or just because we felt like eating a dessert, kheer was what mom always made., , What is Kheer, , , sugar and milk., , In India when we use the word kheer, we are usually referring to the kheer made with rice., , However kheer can be made with other things as well like, tapioca pearls, , carrot, almonds etc. I love all variations but if you are looking for a classic Indian dessert, then it doesn\u2019t get better or more authentic that a bowl of rice kheer or, chawal ki kheer, as we would call in Hindi., , I always prefer using whole milk to make my rice kheer, it makes the kheer more rich and creamy and I highly recommend the same., , , Flavoring the Kheer, , Like I said, few spices and flavors are often added to the kheer to make it even more delicious!, , Cardamom, :, of course the most common and my favorite. I never make my kheer without it., , Rose Water:, a splash of rose water goes a long way in giving the kheer that flowery aroma., , Saffron:, this was not used commonly in my home. But if you are making kheer for a special occasion then you can add some strands of saffron. Will give it a nice color and aroma., , Nuts:, I personally love nuts in my kheer. I usually add cashews, almonds. I like raisins too but Sarvesh isn\u2019t a fan so I don\u2019t usually add them., , Kewra essence:, is an extract distilled from pandanus flowers and used to flavor lot of Indian dishes and desserts. I add it sometimes but completely optional., , Serving Suggestions for Kheer, , So should you serve the kheer warm or chilled?, , The good news is that you can serve it either way, it\u2019s just a personal preference., , Personally, I have, always loved chilled kheer, . I remember whenever mom would have kheer, I would take out my portion in a bowl and place it in the freezer to chill., , I always eat my kheer chilled., , On the other hand, many people I know prefer eating it hot straight out of the pan., , Either way, , , Can you Make Kheer Vegan?, , Yes, definitely!, , Just swap the regular milk with almond milk and it would taste just as good., , In fact I have a recipe for kheer made with almond milk, here, ., , Also to keep the recipe vegan, skip the step of roasting the rice with ghee in the beginning., , Next time you cook an Indian meal, make sure to finish it off with this lovely kheer.

Thank you., , I checked the strength of the cardamom flavor during the 25 minute cooking time.  I \u201cslightly crushed\u201d the cardamom pods to begin with.  The pods were old and the flavor seemed weak.  So I added a few more pods and ground them up a bit in the mortar and pestle before adding them.   Some black seeds remained and some were ground up.

I found it while looking for recipes using cardamom. My swedish heritage uses cardamom and I\u2019m always looking for new and different recipes. My question about your recipe is that you call for cardamom pods slightly crushed. So you put the pod in too? Do you take it out later? Or does it cook down so you can eat it. I don\u2019t want to have someone choke on it! When I cook with whole cloves or bay leaves I always count what I put in so I get them back out before serving. Thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Manali, , says:, , , , January 16, 2024 at 1:15 pm, , , , , you can take it out before serving. In many houses in India, we often serve kheer with the cardamom pod in it and we just put it on the side before eating.

But there\u2019s no way the kheer won\u2019t thicken after cooking the milk for more than 30 minutes. Kheer is a very basic Indian recipe which was made almost every month by my mom and I also make it very very often. So, I am very confident that this recipe is just fine. I think your intensity of heat was too low, maybe try medium-low for your gas next time. Also, as I mention in the recipe card, use 1/3 cup for thicker kheer if that\u2019s what you prefer. This is how kheer is made traditionally, you do need very little rice compared to milk. This isn\u2019t supposed be super thick like American rice pudding. Also everyone has a different preference when it comes to the texture of kheer., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Gopa, , says:, , , , January 19, 2023 at 11:46 pm, , , , , The kheer turned beautifully.

I have made it several times and love the texture and the flavor, it\u2019s heavenly. I prefer the rice pudding to be on the thicker side so I use 1/3 cup rice and cook it for an extra ten minutes, but that\u2019s just based on your texture preference, it\u2019s great no matter how you make it. Also, the rose water is not optional in my opinion, I love it\u2019s flavor and the way it combines with the cardamom, I always add a full two teaspoons.

The whole meal recipe came out well in the bread machine as per your suggestions., , About this kheer, I have always used whole cardamom and never powder. Is it preferable to use powder, it seems like a good idea? And which brand do you buy?, , Similarly have never used saffron in my cooking, but want to try.

I have no idea how to judge the authenticity of saffron., , Thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Jul 25, 2019 at 6:53 pm, , , , , hi tara, that is great. thanks for letting me know., , 1. in the kheer recipe, cardamom can be used whole or powdered. i make cardamom powder in a mixer-grinder. i buy organic cardamoms. take 1/2 cup of cardamoms, 1 tablespoon sugar in a grinder or coffee grinder. grind to a fine powder. the sugar granules help in crushing the peels and make them to a fine powder. no need to remove the peels or husks. just add the whole cardamom pods., , 2. i use kashmiri saffron. this is the brand and it is good \u2013, https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07HG7J2H1/, , for the saffron, the aroma should be intense when you smell it. secondly, when dissolved in water, the saffron should be still orange and not leech color and become white. if the saffron is not original, then after dissolving in water, it will leech color and become like white threads. you can even read reviews for organic saffron. in india, we get good saffron whether we buy them online or in a super store or shop. you can also have a look at spanish saffron., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Tulsi, , says:, , , , Oct 25, 2018 at 8:55 pm, , , , , Perfect \u2026 exactly Marathi style.and words, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Oct 26, 2018 at 1:48 pm, , , , , thanks., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Asma, , says:, , , , Jun 26, 2017 at 9:41 am, , , , , Thank you so much for making the recipe sound so easy.

I used a complete 150 g packet and it was much thicker than in your photos., Many thanks for this!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , dassana amit, , says:, , , , Oct 08, 2014 at 6:43 pm, , , , , thanks jimmy. sure i will update the amount of 1 cup seviyan/vermicelli in the post itself. but i am sure its not 150 gms. it should be around 50 to 80 gms, i think. if the kheer becomes thick, then just add some more hot milk and sugar. the consistency can easily be adjusted as well as the sweetness. you can also add some more cardamom powder and dry fruits to go with the changed consistency., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Aparna, , says:, , , , Oct 01, 2014 at 8:17 pm, , , , , I love this Kheer!

        "Sabudana Kheer": "Ingredients: , In India sabudana is widely used as a fasting food as it boosts energy instantly. This sabudana kheer is one such dish mostly made during religious fastings., Javvarisi Payasam, , , Sabudana Khichdi, and, Sabudana Vada, are other dishes made during Hindu fastings., , Sabudana Kheer is a great summer food too & can be served as a chilled dessert or breakfast on a hot day. It is believed to reduce the body heat and balance the body temperature. It is also given to babies and toddlers to boost energy. If you are looking for ideas to feed sabudana to your baby then you can check here, how to feed sabudana to your baby, ., , About Sabudana Kheer, , Sabudana Kheer is simply made by simmering soaked sago in water until the balls turn transparent and are cooked through. They are later simmered in full fat milk until thick & creamy. Lastly the kheer is sweetened with sugar or jaggery and then flavored with cardamom powder., , It is served either warm or chilled with a garnish of plenty of toasted or ghee fried nuts. While the traditional Sabudana Kheer is made with whole milk (full fat milk) it can also be made with any kind of milk including vegan alternates like, Almond milk, or coconut milk., , To make sabudana kheer you can use any healthy sweetener like jaggery, palm jaggery, coconut sugar or stevia etc. If using jaggery then make sure you turn off the stove & cool down the kheer slightly before adding it. This step prevents the kheer from splitting/curdling the milk., , More, Indian Sweets, Sabudana Payasam, Carrot halwa, Lauki halwa, Moong dal halwa, , , Photo Guide, , How to make Sabudana Kheer (Stepwise Photos), , 1. Rinse \u00bc\u00a0cup sabudana very well at least twice. Then pour 1 cup water and begin to cook stirring often to prevent burning. You can also soak the sabudana first in hot water for 30 mins to overnight to reduce the cook time. Refrigerate soaked & drained sabudana in the fridge for up to 2 days so you can cook anytime easily., , , , 2. When the sabudana turns transparent check if they are cooked through. You can bite a few and check. They should not be hard or chewy. All of the pearls look transparent this is the first sign they are well cooked. Pour 1 cup milk and mix., , , , 3. Continue to cook until they turn completely soft and light. The mixture also turns thick & looks starchy. Then add 1/8 teaspoon cardamom powder., , , , 4. Add 3 to 4\u00a0tablespoons sugar. I used brown sugar. You can also use jaggery. If you add jaggery to the boiling kheer it will curdle. So to use jaggery turn off the stove, cool down a bit & add the grated jaggery. Or make a jaggery syrup following the recipe notes and cool it completely. Then add it here. If using jaggery to kheer, you should never cook it further after adding it to avoid curdling., , , , 5. Since I used sugar I boiled until the sabudana kheer turned thick. It will thicken further upon cooling so turn off when it is of pouring yet thick consistency., , , , Serve sabudana kheer chilled or warm. Garnish with chopped nuts and saffron if you desire., , , , Expert Tips, , , Soaking sabudana for 30 mins in hot water will cut down the cook time., , Sabudana gets cooked faster in water than in milk so I cook them first in water until transparent then add milk., , To make this kheer more richer and delicious, blend 10 to 12 blanched almonds, 1 pinch of saffron with half cup milk until smooth. Then pour it to the kheer towards the end. Simmer just for a few minutes., , You can skip sugar completely and just add finely chopped dates to sweeten the dish. Do not cook once the dates are added as the flavor of the kheer changes., , , , Photo Guide, , Sabudana Kheer for Babies, , Sabudana is cooling to the body so it is ideal to feed your baby during summers. We usually feed sabudana when the baby has a tummy upset or during teething., , Avoid it if your baby is suffering from constipation. Also avoid sugar and salt until your baby is one year old., , You can also add a piece of carrot to the sabudana kheer. Just blend the carrot with water or milk until smooth. When the sabudana is cooked pour the carrot puree and cook until you get the smell of cooked carrots., , \u25a2, \u00bc, , cup, , sabudana, , tapioca pearls (sago), \u25a2, 3 to 4, , tablespoons, , sugar, , or chopped dates or jaggery (refer notes), \u25a2, 1, , cup, , water, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , milk, , (use more if needed), \u25a2, \u215b, , teaspoon, , cardamom powder, , (elaichi powder), \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , nuts, , chopped \u2013 almonds, pistas & cashews, , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Omkar, , , , , , January 9, 2024 3:43 pm, , , , , , Thank you for teaching me how to make sabudana kheer.

You can reduce to 3/4 cup. Cook time depends on the kind of pan and stove. Just cook them until soft and transparent.

Yes we eat ponni raw rice & parboiled, sona masuri raw & parboiled & basmathi. We use organic rice from mustafa. Not very particular about brands as long as they are organic. Earlier I had used murugan raw rice a few times. They are okay. Regarding the age of the rice, we usually enquire and buy. The men in mustafa guide us. For basmati rice, the harvest date is printed on the pack. We use lalquilla basmati old malai.

Yes it can cause wheezing, cold & even phlegm if eaten cold especially if made with sugar. To avoid this we usually feed it luke warm and then avoid sugar. Instead use jaggery as it is warming to the body. Next time avoid feeding it in the night.

If you are using jaggery powder it would be different. It is good to make more jaggery syrup and add it as required because the sweetness levels differ from one brand to the other. If you are making 6 servings, use 1 cup jaggery and 3/4 cup sabudana., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Linda, , , , , , February 2, 2024 5:51 am, , , , , , I\u2019m confused.

        "Moong Dal Halwa": "Ingredients: ghee and sugar., , Whether made with fruits, vegetables, vermicelli, lentils or grains, the mouth-watering Indian halwa is absolutely a must for all dessert lovers., , Halwa is a scrumptious dessert reserved for celebratory occasions too. Though simple to make, it takes some time to cook., , Some very popular halwa varieties in the Indian subcontinent are this Moong Dal Halwa, , Gajar Ka Halwa, and, Suji Ka Halwa, . Unique ones from the list include, Karachi Halwa, , , Besan Halwa, , , Apple Halwa, , , Kashi Halwa, and more., , Expert Tips, , Soaking Lentils:, Remember that soaking of the moong lentils well is important as it helps to soften the dal, which can then be ground easily to a smooth paste., Pans to be used:, Make sure to keep on stirring the moong dal mixture to cook evenly and to prevent it from sticking to the pan. Best is to use a non-stick pan/kadai or a well seasoned kadai or frying pan for this., Sweetness:, I have added 1 cup sugar in this recipe. For more sweetness, add 1 or 2 tablespoons more or add \u00bc cup extra sugar., Milk:, It is best to use full fat whole milk and ghee for this halwa. Brings the classic rich taste. I have mixed milk with water, but you can only use milk or only water., Adding Khoya:, The addition of khoya or mawa (milk solids) gives a more richer flavor and taste to an already rich halwa. Crumble finely and add 1 cup khoya, when the moong dal is cooked golden, looks granular and the ghee has separated. Mix well and add sugar. Continue to stir and cook till you see the moong mixture thickening, reducing and ghee releasing from the sides. Do not add milk if you use khoya., Scaling:, You can halve or double this Moong Dal Halwa recipe easily. Do note that doubling the recipe will involve more stirrings and more hand work., More Halwa Recipes To Try!, Halwa Recipe, Wheat Halwa | Atta Halwa, Sweets Recipes, Kesari Recipe | Rava Kesari, Halwa Recipe, Badam Halwa Recipe (South Indian Style), Halwa Recipe, Beetroot Halwa, , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

Add the ground moong dal. Stir and mix well., Keep on stirring the halwa on a medium-low to medium heat. The halwa has the raw aroma of the moong lentils and it should go away completely before you start with the next step. So till then you have to stir and cook the halwa., The halwa first is pasty, then starts getting lumpy and then starts breaking down and getting separated with the fat releasing from the sides. Break the lumps while stirring., Meanwhile when the halwa is cooking, in another pan or kadai, take milk, water and sugar., Keep this pan on the stove top and stir so that the sugar dissolves. On a low or medium flame, heat this milk-water-sugar mixture till it comes to a boil., The moong dal mixture should reach a granular consistency before you add the hot milk mixture. You should get a fried aroma from the mung lentils and the color should become golden. The fat also should get separated., When the milk mixture comes to a boil, add it to the fried mung lentils., The mixture sizzles, so be careful while adding the hot milk and water mixture., Stir well. Simmer and cook stirring often., The liquids should get absorbed and once again you will see the ghee getting separated., Lastly add cardamom powder, chopped pistachios and raisins., Serve Moong Dal Halwa hot. You can also garnish with some pistachios and serve., , , Notes, * 1 cup sugar is just sweet which we prefer. For more sweetness you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons more of sugar or add \u00bc cup sugar extra., , Make sure to soak the lentils for a few hours so that you can grind them easily to a smooth paste., , Remember not to add too much water while grinding and make the paste or batter runny or watery., , The recipe can be halved or doubled., , , , Nutrition Info (Approximate Values), , Nutrition Facts, , Moong Dal Halwa, , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 662, , Calories from Fat 225, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 25g, 38%, Saturated Fat 15g, 94%, Polyunsaturated Fat 1g, Monounsaturated Fat 7g, Cholesterol, 62mg, 21%, Sodium, 33mg, 1%, Potassium, 133mg, 4%, Carbohydrates, 101g, 34%, Fiber 4g, 17%, Sugar 79g, 88%, Protein, 11g, 22%, , , Vitamin A, 137IU, 3%, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), 0.04mg, 3%, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), 0.1mg, 6%, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), 0.1mg, 1%, Vitamin B6, 0.1mg, 5%, Vitamin B12, 0.2\u00b5g, 3%, Vitamin C, 0.4mg, 0%, Vitamin D, 0.4\u00b5g, 3%, Vitamin E, 0.1mg, 1%, Vitamin K, 0.4\u00b5g, 0%, Calcium, 83mg, 8%, Vitamin B9 (Folate), 1\u00b5g, 0%, Iron, 2mg, 11%, Magnesium, 13mg, 3%, Phosphorus, 55mg, 6%, Zinc, 0.3mg, 2%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , This Moong Dal Halwa recipe post from the archives, first published on March 2014 has been republished and updated on November 2022., , Share This Recipe:, WhatsApp, Facebook, Pin, Tweet, Email, Share, 1.8k, Meet Dassana, Welcome to Dassana's Veg Recipes.

I made this last month and it turned out great. But today it became a bit mushy and sticky (either too much water or too many whistles). I doubled the recipe this time and used 4 cups liquid (water plus milk). Should I make it 3 cups for 1 cup millet? Also I gave 5 whistles. May be 3 whistles would do? Pls let me know! Otherwise perfect!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Raks Kitchen, , says, , , January 18, 2019 at 9:44 am, , , , Reduce to 3-4 whistles. Also add pressure regulator (whistle) once steam comes.

        "Ragi laddus": "Ingredients: , , , , , , , , ghee, powdered sugar and cardamom powder., To make, nachni ladoos, , heat the ghee in a broad non-stick pan, add the ragi flour and cook on a slow flame for 4 to 5 minutes or till it turns golden brown in colour, while stirring continuously. Remove from the flame, add the sugar and mix well very well to break all the lumps. Add the cardamom powder and mix well. Transfer the mixture into a greased plate, spread it evenly and keep aside to cool completely for 10 to 15 minutes. Refrigerate for 15 minutes and keep at room temperature for another 5 minutes. Scrape the ladoo mixture using a spoon and knead it well. Divide it into 12 equal portions and roll each portion into a round ball. Serve or store, nachni ladoos, in an air-tight container. Use as required., We are lucky because the Indian landscape makes available to us a wealth of healthy grains with immeasurable benefits. Most of these grains and their flours are so versatile that they can be used to make everything from khichdis to ladoos. Here is a delicious, ragi ladoo, that proves our point., A nutrient-dense and irresistibly tasty treat laced with cardamom, these ladoos help build your, iron, and, vitamin B complex, reserves. When you feel like snacking, grab two of these power-packed ladoos to shoo away your hunger., Compared to other sweets which are loaded with sugar and / or refined maida, this, healthy recipe for pregnancy, can be a wise pick. A mum-to-be can benefit from the calcium nachni has in bountiful amounts. Each ladoo provides 71.3 mg of calcium., Ragi flour is also enriched with fiber as compared to maida. Fiber is a key nutrient to keep your digestive system healthy. But remember these, ragi laddus, also have some amount of sugar. Hence do not include them on a daily basis. Make them a part of your diet occasionally., Tips for, nachni ladoos, . 1. Saute ragi flour only on slow flame, else it might burn quickly. 2. Add sugar only after removing from flame, else it might harden. 3. You can store them at room temperature in an air-tight container for 4 to 5 days. They stay fresh for upto 10 days in the fridge., Enjoy, nachni ladoos recipe, |, ragi ladoo, |, healthy recipe for pregnancy, |, ragi laddu, | with recipe and video below., , Nachni Ladoos, Ragi Ladoo, Recipe for Pregnancy recipe - How to make Nachni Ladoos, Ragi Ladoo, Recipe for Pregnancy, , , , , , , , Tags, , , , , Non-stick Pan, , Indian Desserts, Sweets, , Peda, Ladoo collection, , Traditional Indian Mithai, , Indian Travel Food, , Indian Travel Food Sweets, Mithai, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Preparation Time, , 10 Mins, , , , , , , Cooking Time, , 5 Mins, , , , , , , Total Time, , 15 Mins, , , , , , , Makes, , 13 ladoos, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , For Nachni Ladoos, , , 1 cup, ragi (nachni / red millet) flour, , , 6 tbsp, ghee, , , 5 tbsp, powdered sugar, , , 1/2 tsp, cardamom (elaichi) powder, , , , , , , coconut, dry fruits, etc., mixing them with sweeteners and spices, and shaping the mixture into, ladoos, using greased palms.

        "Vegan Barfi": "Ingredients: including nuts and cardamom. It comes together in under 30 minutes, and it's the perfect way to ditch the dairy while keeping your holidays sweet., , You might also like, vegan gulab jamun, , , vegan badam katli, and, vegan kaju katli, ., , , I'd call a barfi a fudge-like sweet, but that wouldn't do this delightful Indian treat any justice. While a fudge is spectacularly one-dimensional (sugar, anyone?), a barfi has a certain complexity to it, an ineffable deliciousness that makes it a food fit to sweeten the most special celebrations, from weddings to birthdays to the couple of dozen Indian festivals that dot the calendar each year., , , Before I go any further, let me clarify, for anyone who doesn't know, that a barfi is not a single kind of a sweet: rather, it's a family of sweets, like cakes or cookies are. There are barfis made with milk, probably the most ubiquitous, barfis made with nuts, barfis made with chickpea flour, barfis made with all-purpose flour or maida, barfis made with rice flour, barfis made with coconut... you get the idea., , And the texture of a barfi varies just as greatly as the flavors do, from the firm but velvety bite of a kaju katli to the soft, cloudiness of a malai burfi to the melt-in-the-mouth brittleness of a Mysore Pak, and everything in between., , Barfis are not a particularly difficult sweet to make, but they are not always easy to veganize, because even the versions that don't rely heavily on milk do call for the use of ghee, with the ghee  used more as a flavoring agent than as a fat. And while it is true that ghee adds a certain flavor many identify with, Indian sweets, , leaving it out, in my opinion, does not make your vegan barfi any less delicious. And you'd be doing that poor cow -- and your waistline -- a favor., , This Barfi recipe I have for you today comes together in under 30 minutes. But these are 30 dedicated minutes, so if you're planning on catching up with the laundry while the Barfi cooks, ditch that plan. Or this. Other than that, and some exercise for your right arm, this is a recipe so easy, I'm tempted to say a child could do it., , , , Would you like to save this recipe?, , Enter your email and I'll send this recipe to your inbox!, , , , , Check to get new recipe updates by email., , , , , , , , Tips for making a great vegan barfi:, , , The almond flour and cashew flour should both be very finely ground. You want your barfi mixture to come together and hold together so you can cut it into squares., , Make sure you stir your barfi mixture constantly while it's on the stove-- this will likely take about 15 minutes. Nuts have a tendency to burn because of their high fat content, and you don't want burnt bits in your barfi., , Work over low or medium-low heat. Again, because you don't want anything to burn., , Once your mixture starts pulling off the sides of the pan, continue stirring until your mixture goes from translucent to opaque and is not sticky anymore. Getting that stickiness out of the equation is really important or your barfi will be gummy rather than tender., , , , , Almond flour, , Raw cashews (you will need to powder these really fine. If you can find very finely ground cashew flour, that would work too), , Sugar (try and use a vegan cane sugar, mainly for the aesthetics. Turbinado or coconut sugar will add a dark cast to your barfi, but they are perfectly acceptable), , Cardamom, , Coconut oil, , Nuts for garnish -- pistachios, almonds, cashews are all fine here., , , More vegan Indian sweets, , Vegan Sooji Halwa (Rava Kesari or Sheera), Vegan Cashew Halwa (Naturally Sweetened), Vegan Kheer (Indian Rice Pudding), Vegan Kalakand, , , Recipe, , , , Vegan Barfi, , , Vaishali \u00b7 Holy Cow Vegan, , , This vegan version of Barfi, a classic Indian sweet, including nuts and cardamom.

I pressed the crumbs into a tin and refrigerated it and it came out OK in taste but it was very dry!

That said, I think it's worth experimenting to see if it might work--the water is not much so it would evaporate quickly., I think subbing the monk fruit sweetener would be fine but sugar also adds some moisture to the recipe so you might get a dryer barfi., If you do try these tweaks, I'd love to hear how it goes, and other readers might benefit too!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , LCV in Vermont, , , November 15, 2020 at 10:26 am, , , , I had a little mishap with over cooking, first.  It sort of seized and dried out.  So I put everything back in the blender with a little water and cooked a bit longer.  The second time I may have pulled it off the heat too soon, because it was still a sticky.  But, the result was delicious and I'm sure I'll get the consistency right with practice.  ?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vaishali, , , November 15, 2020 at 5:42 pm, , , , Hi, yes, it does tend to dry out if left too long in the skillet.

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: , Place the water and sugar in a heavy-bottomed wok or skillet (non-stick works best for this). Add the cardamom and let it come to a boil., Turn the heat to low or medium-low. Add the cashew flour and almond flour and mix. Continue stirring at very frequent intervals, making sure your flour is not sticking to the bottom. If it is, scrape it up rightaway., Within a few minutes, the mixture will begin to pull off the sides and bottom of the pan. Add the coconut oil at this point. The mixture will be quite translucent and sticky at this stage, which will make stirring it a bit of a pain, but persist. Since stoves vary, you might want to turn up your heat just a teeny bit if this is taking too long, but around 12-15 minutes after you began cooking, the mixture should turn opaque and dry (meaning it won't be sticky anymore). If you make a ball, it should hold together. Turn off the heat at this point and remove the mixture to a bowl., As soon as you can handle the dough, knead it into a smooth ball. I like kneading in a little cashew cream into the mixture at this time because it just makes the barfi softer, which I love. You can skip this step., Lay a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet or a flat baking pan. Pat out the barfi mixture on it in an even layer, about six inches square (or thinner, if you want thinner barfis). Press the sides to make them as even as possible., Press some nuts for garnish on the top and let the barfi cool completely. When cool, cut the barfi into pieces. The barfi will store in the refrigerator for at least a week., , , Nutrition, Serving:, 1, piece, Calories:, 154, kcal, Carbohydrates:, 17, g, Protein:, 3, g, Fat:, 9, g, Saturated Fat:, 2, g, Sodium:, 2, mg, Potassium:, 69, mg, Fiber:, 1, g, Sugar:, 13, g, Calcium:, 19, mg, Iron:, 1, mg, , , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Let us know in the comments below!, , , You may also like, Vegan Kesar Pista Cake, Chik-Cha Halwa (An Indian Jewish Sweet), Vegan Badam Katli (Almond Barfi), Vegan Mango Bread, , , , 1036, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , About, Vaishali, Hi!

And no, cashew butter and cream are not the same. Cashew butter is made much like peanut butter, by grinding the nuts alone. Cashew cream is made by blending raw cashews with a liquid to create an ingredient that resembles cream and can substitute for it in recipes.

        "Vegan mishti doi": "Ingredients: How to make vegan mishti doi, Recipe FAQs, More delicious vegan Indian sweets, Recipe, Reviews, , What is mishti doi?, , Mishti Doi literally translates from Bengali to \"sweet yogurt.\" It is a yogurt-based sweet that's often made during Bengali celebrations, including Durga Puja and Diwali. Its beauty, to my mind, is that it's stunningly simple, relying on the natural deliciousness of yogurt combined with caramelized sugar or natural palm sugar to create amazing flavor., , But making mishti doi involves more than stirring sugar into yogurt. There's some boiling and stirring of milk involved, although it doesn't take too long, and you then set the milk with yogurt, wait overnight or for however long it takes for all of it to set, then eat it. Mishti doi is traditionally set in small terracotta ramekins, which help absorb moisture from the yogurt, because you want your mishti doi to always be very, very thick with no apparent whey., , Mishti doi, in its authentic form, is made with palm jaggery--domed lumps of brown, unrefined sugar. But more modern versions use sugar. I love coconut sugar in this recipe, and it gives the vegan mishti doi a more authentic flavor. But this time I used cane sugar, which I had on hand, and to add that rich flavor I caramelized it. You can use any vegan sugar or, if you have jaggery, , , Sugar, .

You can use a regular yogurt with active live cultures instead of probiotics., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Deb, , , February 23, 2025 at 8:11 pm, , , , Wow, just wow!! I am from Bengal and mishti doi is one of the non-vegan treats I missed the most, until now. This vegan mishti doi turned out really good. Instead of using probiotic capsules directly for the doi, I made half a cup of \"starter\" soy yogurt with one probiotic capsule and then used this starter to ferment the mishti doi in a yogurt maker for 8 hours. I sweetened the yogurt with palm jaggery and Nielsen-Massey vanilla.  Oh my, I was in heaven when I tasted the result!!

It's hard to believe that sugar and yogurt can create such tremendous flavor together, but cooking the milk (nondairy milk in this case) and the sugar together and then letting it ferment with a probiotic makes all the difference. You get a sweet, thick, caramelized yogurt with striking, tangy notes., , It's simple, . There's not much skill involved in making a mishti doi, your job's that much easier., , It's everyone-friendly., If you, or someone you are feeding, cannot tolerate lactose, this is the recipe for you. It has all the flavor and none of the milk. It's also soy-free, gluten-free, and you can make it with full-fat coconut milk for a nut-free version (although I do prefer the flavor of mishti doi made with cashew milk). See FAQs below on how to make this with coconut milk., , It's nutritious, . There is sugar here but this is not a cloyingly sweet food. The probiotic yogurt packs in lots of benefits--and protein, if you make it with cashews., , It's great anytime, . Mishti doi is usually classified as a dessert sweet but it makes a tremendous breakfast or anytime snack., , It's compassionate, . Festivities in India are typically accompanied by lots of sweets, most of them dairy-based. But there's no reason for animals to suffer when we humans celebrate and what better time can there be to show compassion?, , , , , Would you like to save this recipe?, , Enter your email and I'll send this recipe to your inbox!, , , , , Check to get new recipe updates by email., , , , , , , , , , Raw cashews, . We will use these to make cashew cream. Don't use store-bought cashew milk or any other nut milks, which tend to be too thick, in this recipe--you want homemade cashew cream for the right consistency., , Two vegan probiotic capsules, . I use the PB8 vegetarian probiotic capsules (in the green bottle). If you already have a cultured vegan yogurt that's thick (like my, vegan Instant Pot yogurt, ), use that instead, although the probiotic capsules will result in a thicker mishti doi, which is the result we're going for. If using a yogurt starter add it at the same time as you would the probiotic capsules., , Superfine almond flour or powder., Buy storebought almond flour or make your own, but make sure it's a fine powder. It helps thicken the yogurt and adds more depth of flavor., , Pure vanilla extract., This is not a traditional ingredient and it's optional, but I like it in here to add a bit of depth and sweetness to the cashew milk., , , , How to make vegan mishti doi, , , Blend the cashews with the 2 cups of distilled or filtered water into a very smooth milk/cream. Set aside., , Place the sugar in a heavy saucepan with 2 tablespoon water. Let the sugar melt and then caramelize. The sugar will clump before it melts and then loosen up, so don't worry if it takes a little while. Keep stirring the sugar frequently so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and burn., , Let the sugar turn a rich caramel color, then turn the heat down to the lowest point or turn it off. Pour in the cashew milk gently. Take care and stand back as the milk can bubble when it hits the hot caramel., , Turn the heat back on to medium high and let the milk come to a boil. Stir frequently. The milk will begin to thicken in a few minutes. Once it has thickened, stir in the almond flour and mix well., , Add the vanilla extract, if using, and turn off the heat. Let the cashew cream sit for a few minutes until it's lukewarm to the touch, around 110 degrees. Don't add the probiotic capsules before it reaches this temperature or the high heat will kill the good bacteria and the yogurt won't set., , Open the probiotic capsules and stir the powder into the cashew cream. Immediately pour it into four ramekins or a single large heat-safe bowl. Make sure first that they will fit inside the Instant Pot liner, if you are using an IP., , Place the ramekins or the bowl inside the Instant Pot liner. Close the IP lid and set it to the \"yogurt\" function for 8-10 hours. Eight hours will yield a less tangy mishti doi, if that's what you prefer. I find 10 hours works just right for me.If you don't have an Instant Pot, leave the mishti doi out in a warm spot for 24-36 hours, like a cold oven with the light turned on. My oven light is on the fritz so I left a ramekin on the countertop in my September kitchen, with daytime temps in the 70s, and it took around 36 hours to set., , Once the mishti doi has set, garnish it with nuts and saffron, if you wish. Chill for a couple of hours at least before serving., , , , , , , , , , , , , , Recipe FAQs, , Do I need an Instant Pot to make the mishti doi?, , You don't, and you can absolutely make the vegan mishti doi the traditional way, by placing it in a warm spot in your home. The mishti doi will take a little longer to set than regular yogurt would. In my cool September kitchen with daytime temps in the 60s and 70s it took more than 36 hours. An Instant Pot makes quick work of this and is quite foolproof, but it is not necessary., , , I am nut-free. Can I substitute the cashews?, , Cashews work really well in a vegan version of mishti doi because they are a great thickener and they create the perfect consistency. However, if you are nut-free, you can use full fat coconut milk. Add a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch to the coconut milk (when you'd add the almond flour) to thicken it. Skip the almond flour if you are nut-free., , , I like my mishti doi sweeter. Can I add more sugar?, , Definitely, and I suggest a range in the recipe card below, from \u2153rd of a cup, which is the amount I use, to \u00bd a cup. You can add even more sugar if you prefer, although mishti doi shouldn't be cloyingly sweet., , , Can I add flavorings to the mishti doi?, , Mishti doi tastes at its best when it's at its simplest. But a bit of cardamom stirred into the cashew milk before you set it with the probiotic would be nice., You can also garnish the mishti doi with nuts and saffron before or after it sets., , , Can I use terracotta bowls or ramekins to make the mishti doi?, , Terracotta bowls are traditionally used to set mishti doi and their porousness helps thicken the dahi or yogurt nicely. But I wouldn't use a terracotta ramekin or bowl inside an Instant Pot unless the product specifically says it is oven-safe. If you are not using an Instant Pot, however, and plan to set the yogurt in a warm spot in your home, you can definitely use terracotta or clay bowls., , , , More delicious vegan Indian sweets, , Vegan Gulab Jamun, Vegan Kheer (Indian Rice Pudding), Vegan Rabri, Vegan Barfi, , , Recipe, , , , Vegan Mishti Doi, , , Vaishali \u00b7 Holy Cow Vegan, , , The Bengali sweetened yogurt dish, Mishti Doi, is literally one of the most delicious things you can ever eat.

Pour in the cashew milk gently. Take care and stand back as the milk can bubble when it hits the hot caramel., Turn the heat back on to medium high and let the milk come to a boil. Stir frequently. The milk will begin to thicken in a few minutes. Once it has thickened, stir in the almond flour and mix well., Add the vanilla extract, if using, and turn off the heat. Let the cashew cream sit for a few minutes until it's lukewarm to the touch, around 110 degrees. Don't add the probiotic capsules before it reaches this temperature or the high heat will kill the good bacteria and the yogurt won't set., Open the probiotic capsules and stir the powder into the cashew cream. Immediately pour it into four ramekins or a single large heat-safe bowl. Make sure first that they will fit inside the Instant Pot liner, if you are using an IP., Place the ramekins or the bowl inside the Instant Pot liner. Close the IP lid and set it to the \"yogurt\" function for 8-10 hours. Eight hours will yield a less tangy mishti doi, if that's what you prefer. I find 10 hours works just right for me., If you don't have an Instant Pot, leave the mishti doi out in a warm spot for 24-36 hours, like a cold oven with the light turned on. My oven light is on the fritz so I left a ramekin on the countertop in my September kitchen, with daytime temps in the 70s, and it took around 36 hours to set., Once the mishti doi has set, garnish it with nuts and saffron, if you wish. Chill for a couple of hours at least before serving., , , Notes, , If using jaggery in this recipe, you can skip the step for caramelizing the sugar. Instead heat the cashew milk, and once it begins to boil, stir in the jaggery. Make sure that the jaggery is powdered or chopped into really small pieces before you stir it in, and also make sure it melts completely into the milk before you stop cooking., , Make sure you use ramekins that will fit inside the Instant Pot liner and are oven-safe.

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: , Soak the cashews in the almond milk, for at least 30 minutes or preferably for several hours or overnight., Blend the cashews and milk into a really smooth milk., Place the cashew milk in a large wok. Turn heat to medium and let the cashew milk cook, stirring it frequently, until it starts to dry up at the sides. Keep mixing the drying portions back into the milk. Continue doing this off and on, monitoring the heat at all times to make sure nothing burns. Reduce heat if necessary., After about 10 minutes the milk will have thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add the almond flour and sugar and continue cooking and stirring for another five minutes. Let the rabri thicken to the consistency you want. Cashew milk tends to thicken as it stands, so don't make your rabri too thick., As soon as the rabri is the consistency you want, stir in the saffron, cardamom powder and vanilla. Stir in and turn off the heat., Once the rabri reaches room temperature, chill it for best flavor. Before serving, garnish with dried fruit or nuts, like pistachios, blanched almonds and cashews., , , Nutrition, Calories:, 215, kcal, Carbohydrates:, 31, g, Protein:, 4, g, Fat:, 10, g, Saturated Fat:, 1, g, Sodium:, 132, mg, Potassium:, 85, mg, Fiber:, 1, g, Sugar:, 26, g, Calcium:, 137, mg, Iron:, 1, mg, , , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Let us know in the comments below!, You may also like, Vegan Kesar Pista Cake, Chik-Cha Halwa (An Indian Jewish Sweet), Vegan Badam Katli (Almond Barfi), Vegan Sooji Halwa (Rava Kesari or Sheera), , , , 90, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , About, Vaishali, Hi!

        "Vegan gajar ka halwa": "Ingredients: and keeping each flavor clean will give you the best results. You will need to blend a cup of raw cashews with three cups of water., , When you mix the milk and the carrots, it will look like you have a disproportionately large amount of milk, but don't worry. As you cook the halwa, the carrots will absorb the milk and some of the liquid will evaporate., , You have some leeway in how long you cook your halwa. I like to make it really dry (as in it's still moist and succulent, but there isn't any visible liquid). But I've eaten versions of carrot halwa that are more pudding-y and they taste quite good. I like cooking it a bit longer because I find that removes the grassy flavor of the carrot and leaves just its deliciousness behind., , You can use sugar to sweeten your halwa, like I did, or you can make it with no sugar added. Instead, sweeten it naturally with dates. Soak your dates in hot water for at least 30 minutes and blend them as smoothly as possible. I would use half a cup of the cashew milk to blend them and then add them at the same time as the carrots and milk (instead of a little later, as with the sugar)., , , Now that you're armed with all of my gajar ka halwa wisdom, let's move on and get cooking. And to all readers of Holy Cow!, a very happy Diwali., , , , Carrots., Richer colored carrots will give you better color.

I will try it, but not in a nonstick pan, as I am aware that they are made of materials which are bad for health and cause a lot of pollution all around the world. Haven't you seen the movie \"Dark Waters\" ? I use only stainless steel pans.

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: , Blend the cashews with 3 cups water into a very smooth milk/cream. If your blender isn't very powerful, soak the cashews in water for at least an hour first., Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pan, preferably nonstick. A wider pan will allow the liquid to thicken and evaporate more easily. Add the sliced almonds or any other nuts you are using. Saute them for a couple of minutes until they just begin to change color. Add the carrots and cardamom, saute a couple of minutes, then add the cashew milk. * (If using dates to sweeten, see notes below before adding all the milk)., Cook, stirring occasionally, over medium-low heat until most of the milk has been absorbed into the cashews. This will take at least 15-20 minutes. If it's going too slow, increase the heat a bit but keep an eye on the carrots and stir them often because you don't want them to stick to the bottom., Add the sugar and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and stir until it's well mixed and the sugar has dissolved., At this stage, you can pretty much decide how much longer you want your halwa to cook -- taking it off the heat at this point will give you a more pudding-like texture, but you can continue to cook longer until the halwa pulls off the bottom and sides of the pan and there's absolutely no visible liquid. I like to cook the halwa to this stage, but it means some exercise for your arm, so be warned., Once the halwa reaches the desired state of doneness, take if off the heat. You can eat the halwa warm or at room temperature or cold, it's delicious every way. Garnish with sliced almonds before serving, if you wish., , , Notes, , If cooking with dates, soak the dates for 30 minutes in hot water, then blend into a very smooth paste with \u00bd cup of the cashew milk you'll be using. Add the date-cashew milk mixture to the pan at the same time as you add the rest of the cashew milk and continue cooking.

Do I need to leave the jamuns in there for three hours?, I poked holes and left them in for five mins then waited a bit after taking them out and they are not sweet. Is it bc of the lemon juice?

In the middle of making them right now!, Thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vaishali, , , September 28, 2023 at 7:37 pm, , , , The lemon juice adds flavor to the sugar syrup. You need very little.

I have a clarification - the jamun balls are getting flaky (not cracking or breaking, but doesn\u2019t have a smooth consistency) on the outside after I put in sugar syrup. They end up losing the dark brown color to a light one and has a very uneven texture., Could this be due to more ratio of bread crumbs?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vaishali, , , September 03, 2023 at 1:27 pm, , , , Hi Vandana, so happy you tried the gulab jamuns. I've not encountered this specific problem before, but my assumption is that the bread crumbs are probably not ground fine enough, which could cause the jamuns to not hold together firmly. Try giving them more time in the blender/food processor. Don't change the ratio of bread crumbs to cashew milk., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vandana, , , September 03, 2023 at 6:15 pm, , , , Thank you, Vaishali, for the inputs. Will try that soon enough!

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: , Make the sugar syrup:, Place the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to a simmer, add the cardamom and lemon juice, and let it cook for another five minutes. Turn off heat., Make the gulab jamuns:, Place the breadcrumbs in a bowl and mix in the cashew cream, a little at a time until you have a smooth, pliable dough that's not too stiff or dry., Divide into 14 equal sized pieces and roll each into a ball. You want a very smooth ball with no visible cracks on the surface. You can use some oil to grease your palms, which will help you shape the jamuns more easily., Heat oil in a wok or a fryer. You don't want to oil to be too hot, around 300 degrees is ideal. If the oil is too hot, the jamuns will brown very fast on the outside and not cook all the way through., Now place the jamuns, a few at a time so as to not clutter, into the fryer or wok. The oil should bubble only slightly. Don't let the jamuns settle at the bottom. Use your spider or a slotted ladle to keep moving them around until they become a deep, reddish color., Remove them to a plate lined with a paper towel. When the jamun is still warm but can be handled, use a very thin pin or needle to poke holes all around. This will help it better absorb the syrup., Place the jamuns inside the syrup while the syrup is still warm but not very hot. They should be completely immersed. Let them stand for 3 hours before serving, so they have enough time to soak up the syrup., Serve jamuns with a drizzle of the syrup and a sprinkling of nuts (optional)., , , Nutrition, Serving:, 2, gulab jamuns, Calories:, 353, kcal, Carbohydrates:, 47, g, Protein:, 8, g, Fat:, 16, g, Saturated Fat:, 2, g, Polyunsaturated Fat:, 4, g, Monounsaturated Fat:, 8, g, Sodium:, 287, mg, Potassium:, 177, mg, Fiber:, 3, g, Sugar:, 17, g, Vitamin A:, 1, IU, Vitamin C:, 1, mg, Calcium:, 87, mg, Iron:, 3, mg, , , , , , , , Tried this recipe?, Let us know in the comments below!, You may also like, Vegan Kesar Pista Cake, Chik-Cha Halwa (An Indian Jewish Sweet), Vegan Badam Katli (Almond Barfi), Vegan Sooji Halwa (Rava Kesari or Sheera), , , , 3611, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , About, Vaishali, Hi!

Thank you., , , Reply, , , , , , , , JN, , , October 20, 2016 at 1:30 pm, , , , Seems like it! Its the first recipe of yours that has not turned out well. I did drain the Lentils but I think the 2 cups to 1 cup was too much as it cooked pretty fast and the batter was not as thick as a pancake. I feel so sad as I was so looking fwd to it. Oh well.....:-((, , , Reply, , , , , , , , JN, , , October 20, 2016 at 9:22 am, , , , I made these last night and it was disastrous! There was far too much milk and I cooked it for 1 1/2 hr, the entire time it was bubbling like a lava, splattering everywhere, on me, despite cooking non stop the entire time, it had far too much moisture! I followed every step. :-((, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Vaishali, , , October 20, 2016 at 9:53 am, , , , I have made this recipe at least a few times now and this does not sound right. If you cook the chana dal and grind it, the mixture becomes a fairly thick paste with pancake-batter-like thickness, so it's hard to imagine how you could have something with so much liquid that it wouldn't reduce. The lentils keep expanding and absorbing moisture. You probably used too much liquid without realizing it or did not drain the chana dal from the initial soaking water. Also while any thick mixture on the stove will sputter and splatter, your experience sounds extreme., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , chessiepique, , , October 19, 2016 at 6:16 am, , , , Can't wait to try this!

        "Vegan Semiya Payasam": "Ingredients: you are pretty much set. The dish typically is made with\u00a0vermicelli, a very thin noodle that you can find at any Indian store, but I use -- and prefer-- angel hair pasta. That's because I can buy\u00a0whole-wheat angel hair pasta which\u00a0makes the dish a tad healthier than if I were to use\u00a0the refined-flour vermicelli. Better still, if I get a craving, I don't have to drive the half hour I need to get to the Indian store because I can find angel hair pasta at any supermarket., , To make this kheer or payasam extra delicious, I\u00a0use a secret ingredient that I often turn to when making dairy-based, Indian desserts without the dairy, : vanilla extract. This unconventional addition\u00a0is something I picked up from my mom, who was an incredible cook, and who would add all kinds of extracts and essences, with vanilla being her favorite, to Indian sweets. As I have explored vegan versions of Indian sweets, I have found that the vanilla adds great depth to the non-dairy milk base without screaming \"I'm here.\", , I have been feeling a bit under the weather today, and this has already turned into a super-long post, so I am going to shut up now and get on with the recipe.

        "Vegan puran poli": "Ingredients: , 1x, 2x, 3x, For the poli, 1 \u00bd, , cups, , all-purpose flour, , (you can use whole-wheat but a high-gluten flour gives a beautiful, flaky texture that you won't get with whole wheat), 1, , teaspoon, , sooji, , (rava or cream of wheat), 1, , teaspoon, , rice flour, \u00bc, , teaspoon, , salt, 2, , teaspoon, , avocado oil or any neutral oil, Water, For the puran, 1, , cup, , chana dal, , (bengal gram dal), 1, , cup, , jaggery, , (chopped. You can substitute sugar, although be warned that jaggery is what makes this dish truly special with its richness-- you can find it at any Indian grocery store), 1, , teaspoon, , ground cardamom, 1, , teaspoon, , avocado oil or any neutral oil, , then add enough water to knead into a fairly soft, slightly sticky dough. You want a sticky dough so you can roll out your polis quite thin, the way they should be., Place in a box with a fitted lid and set aside for at least half an hour., Make the puran, Cook the chana dal until tender but not mushy. The lentils should still be whole, so you can drain out all the cooking water easily., Place the drained, cooked chana dal and the jaggery in a food processor and process until you have a fine paste. DON'T add any water., Heat the oil in a heavy skillet. Add the powdered chana dal and jaggery and cardamom powder and cook, stirring constantly. The mixture will begin to thicken up and you want it to go until it's just beginning to come off the sides and bottom of the skillet, but is still sticky and not powdery., Set the puran aside. When it is cool enough to be handled, shape into 1-inch balls and set aside., Assemble and cook the puran poli, Now take the dough you prepared earlier for the poli and break off a piece, about half the size of the ball of puran., Roll it out, using as little flour as possible, into a disc about 3 inches in diameter., Place the ball of puran in the center and pull the edges of the dough over the top and seal the ends together. The puran should be completely ensconced in the dough., Flatten the ball gently and, again using as little flour as possible, roll it into a disc about 6 inches in diameter., Heat a griddle and place the poli on it. Cook until golden-brown spots begin to appear at the bottom and the poli begins to puff up. Flip over and cook the other side until done., You can brush the poli with a little oil, if you like, although that's really not necessary., In Maharashtra, puran polis are traditionally eaten with Kathachi Amti, a spicy, watery concoction made with the stock left over from boiling the chana dal, or with some ghee or milk.

Pour this mixture into a, nut-milk bag, (over the sink), place the nut milk bag onto a, small strainer, over a bowl, gently twist the top of the nut milk bag closed, and refrigerate overnight (or for at least 8-10 hours)., , 2. Once the \"cheese\" is ready, pre-heat the oven to 350F. Line a small baking sheet with some, parchment paper, and set aside. When you open the nut milk bag you should have a formed soft ball of \"cheese\" at this stage and some liquid drained into the bowl underneath the strainer (the liquid can be discarded). Using a, small cookie scoop, (or can just use a spoon), scoop out about 2 tablespoon of the \"cheese\" mixture and gently form into a ball with your hands. Place this ball onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining mixture (spacing the balls on the tray at least an inch apart) -- you should end up with 7 balls in total. Bake in a pre-heated oven for 15 mins, then remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack., , 3. While the \"cheese\" balls are baking, prepare the \"rabri\" sauce: place a pinch of saffron in a cup of freshly boiled water and allow to sit and steep for a few minutes (to infuse the water with the saffron flavor and color). Place this saffron water infusion (including the saffron strands) in a, power blender, , 4. Once the \"cheese\" balls are baked, they can be enjoyed with the sauce. You can either divide them into small serving dishes and cover with the \"rabri\" sauce, or can place all on one larger dish (or glass storage container). Garnish with pistachios and rose petals. Enjoy right away or allow the balls to sit in the \"rabri\" sauce in the fridge for a few hours to become more infused with the flavor of the sauce. Refrigerate leftovers., , , , , , , , Notes, , , *To pre-soak cashews: place in a glass bowl, cover with water, and leave to soak for 4 hours (or overnight in the fridge). Then strain and discard the water. For a quick pre-soak, cover with boiled water and soak for 15 mins, then strain and discard water. (Note: this technique doesn\u2019t preserve the nutrition of the recipe as well as the traditional soaking technique above). Note: the purpose of soaking the nuts is to re-hydrate them and plump them up for blending into a smooth, cheesecake-like consistency. Proper soaking techniques also maximize nutrition and digestibility.

Otherwise you can try rice syrup, or coconut nectar, etc., , I haven't tried this dry sugar or stevia powder. I imagine it would be possible to do though, but you might need to add more liquid to help things blend properly and achieve the right consistency, as as you can imagine taking out 3/4 cup of maple syrup (aka a thick liquid) from the recipe and adding in a tiny pinch of stevia powder would alter the consistency. So you'll need to play around with it a little and add a bit more liquid (a little at a time though) until you reach the right consistency and sweetness level to your taste., , If you give it a try with an alternative and end up with something tasty, do share what worked for you.

Have you tried 'cultured' cashews and then add maple sugar instead of syrup? I culture soaked, pasted cashews for 18-24 hrs (depending on how 'cheezy' I want it tasting)  with a couple of vegan acidophilus capsules and sugar. That may help with the tart flavor and moisture content. Lastly, I am reading that some rasamalai recipes have rice powder or some starch component added to the dough to keep it together. Will that help? Thank you !! Maha, , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Audrey, , says, , , October 10, 2018 at 11:37 pm, , , , Hi Maha. Thanks for the awesome suggestions., , The lemon juice here helps to culture the \"cheese.\" I've never tried cultured cashews the way you describe them -- sounds interesting and I'll have to give that a try sometime., , While experimenting, I have tried some of the rasmalai balls with rice flour or a mix of flour and starch, as you're right that is the traditional way to make them. In the end I decided to keep the recipe grain-free as that makes it accessible to more of my readers in this case so left it grain-free. That said, I have made \"cheese\" pancakes using basically the \"cheese\" culture from this recipe in combination with a flour and they worked great, so if anyone wanted to give those a go in combination with the rabri sauce here I think they would be great together:, https://www.unconventionalbaker.com/vegan-syrniki-cheese-pancakes-recipe/, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Audrey, , says, , , October 10, 2018 at 11:38 pm, , , , P.S. if you try the recipe out but with the culture you described for the cashews instead of with lemon juice, I'd love to hear how it turned out!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Cassie Thuvan Tran, , says, , , March 21, 2018 at 4:32 pm, , , , What an interesting recipe!

I've thought about macadamia as well, but didn't have any on hand to play around with. I went for cashews because they are naturally sweeter and milder in flavor. With macadamia, I suspect the recipe would need more sweetness in the \"cheese balls\" and an adjustment of flavors to taste otherwise.

The remaining mixture is (sometimes mixed with a bit of flour or cornstarch and then) kneaded and formed into balls that then get cooked in boiling sugar water before being added to the creamy \"rabri\" sauce for eating., , My recipe is definitely an unconventional workaround for this process. The cashew-based \"cottage cheese\" balls meant to replace the chena here take longer to curdle and form into a workable texture than the traditional (so plan to make a day ahead). Moreover, the initial resulting texture of the mixture is softer and although totally doable, , I also from the get go didn't like the idea of making the boiled \"sugar\" mixture because I use, maple syrup, as my sweetener, and it's certainly not as cheap as plain sugar -- to make the boiling syrup (which combines a good dose of, maple syrup, with water), only to discard this mixture when done boiling the balls felt somewhat wasteful., , So instead I lightly baked my \"cheese\" balls to firm them up a little and they worked out great. The texture comes out perfect that way, and the whole process is super simple., , , , - When the traditional balls get cooked in the sugar water syrup they get infused with sweetness on the inside. Because I skipped that step, I opted for adding in some, maple syrup, into the \"cheese\" balls mixture instead. It worked, although they are not as sweet that way (compared to the boiled version I made of this recipe), but the sweetness of the sauce compensates for it. I thought the texture was more important here, and the baked balls worked great for that., , - In the traditional process of making the cheese balls part, the liquid gets squeezed out of the milk and lemon juice mixture really well, and as a result most of the lemon juice gets drained right out so that the tang is gone out of the recipe. In the recipe below though that doesn't happen as I didn't want to also squeeze out the, maple syrup, and lose some of the cashew liquid as well through the nut-milk bag in the process. As a result there is a mild lemony taste to the balls., , Of course, as I continue making this, I'll keep experimenting and if one day I figure out a better work around to address the few small issues above I'll be sure to update this space., , For now, I'm sharing this recipe with you knowing that it's not 100% authentic, but comes very close to the version I used to love and have missed over the years. After experimenting with many, many batches of this treat I finally landed on something I personally enjoyed very much (and yes, there was a happy dance involved when it finally came together!), so I figured some of you out there would love to have this option, imperfect and all, for a dairy-free and refined sugar-free version of this lovely treat.

You should be able to get \u00bd cup chopped jaggery. You can also use jaggery powder, instead of chopped jaggery., Then add the jaggery in a bowl or pan containing 1.5 cups water., Keep the bowl or pan on low to medium flame and let the solution heat through. Stir so that the jaggery melts., You just need to melt the jaggery. When the jaggery melts, then filter the syrup and keep aside., Now chop a small piece of coconut in small bits. You will need about \u00bc cup chopped coconut. You can even use grated coconut or you can skip coconut altogether., Making banana appam batter, Heat 2 teaspoons ghee in a pan. Then add the chopped coconut., Stir often and saute them till they are light golden. Keep aside., In a pan, peel and chop the bananas. Mash the bananas with a fork or masher very well., There should be no chunks in the bananas. You can even puree the bananas in a blender., Add green cardamom powder, ginger powder and cumin powder., Mix very well. To the bowl containing the jaggery solution, add the rice flour., Add black sesame seeds. You can also use white sesame seeds., Begin to mix very well. Make a smooth batter without any lumps., Add the pureed bananas to the rice flour mixture along with the coconut., Add the baking soda. Baking soda makes the texture more porous and soft. If you want you can skip too., Mix thoroughly., Making sweet appam, Heat the appe pan and add \u00bd to 1 teaspoon ghee in each mould.

        "Dry Fruits Ladoo": "Ingredients: , , \u25a2, 1, , cup, , chopped dates, \u25a2, 3, , tablespoons, , almonds, \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , raisins, \u25a2, 2, , tablespoons, , cashews, \u25a2, 8, , dried figs, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , desiccated coconut, , \u2013 optional, \u25a2, 2, , green cardamoms, , \u2013 crushed in a mortar-pestle, , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark while making the recipe,  Instructions: , Roasting almonds, Firstly begin to roast the almonds in a pan until they get browned., Keep stirring the almonds at intervals. You can also lightly roast the almonds. Set aside., Chopping dates and figs, Roughly chop the dates and figs., You will be needing 1 cup of chopped dates \u2013 so measure the chopped dates and set aside., First lightly crush the cardamom pods in a mortar-pestle. Then remove the peels and crush the seeds coarsely. Set aside., Making dry fruit laddu mixture, In a spice grinder, blender or mixer-grinder add the chopped dates, figs, cashews, raisins, almonds, desiccated coconut and the coarsely powdered cardamom powder., Add the roasted almonds., Grind to a coarse mixture and spread on a tray or plate or take the mixture in a bowl., Forming laddu, Make small balls from your hands and the dry fruit laddu are ready., Serving and Storage, Serve the dry fruit laddu immediately or store in an air tight container and refrigerate. Dry fruit ladoo stays good for a few days at room temperature and a couple of weeks in the refrigerator., You could also make a large batch and refrigerate them for a few weeks or freeze them for a couple of months., , , Notes, Nuts:, Any nuts work well in the recipe. While I use nuts which are easily available to me, you can make these healthy ladoo with the nuts that are available to you locally \u2013 walnuts, pine nuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, hazel nuts. I get almonds, cashews, pistachios and walnuts locally, so I add these. You can use various proportions of the nuts., , Dry Fruits:, I recommend not to skip dates and figs in this recipe. Both have cohesive sticky properties which help you to bind and form the laddu. They also add so much sweetness that you do not need to add any sugar or any other sweetener., , Dates:, Use good quality dates. Preferably use pitted dates. If the dates have seeds, then remove the seeds and chop them., , Dried figs:, If the figs are too dry, tough or dense, then soak them in hot water for a couple of hours. Later drain all the water, pat dry them with a clean kitchen towel and then chop them., , Desiccated coconut:, Skip adding desiccated coconut if you do not have it. You can also add 2 tablespoons fresh grated coconut instead and they will give a good taste as well. But note that with fresh coconut, the shelf life will reduce considerably. So try to consume it quickly and refrigerate any leftovers for 1 to 2 days., , Scaling:, The recipe can be doubled or tripled easily to make a big batch., , , , Nutrition Info (Approximate Values), , Nutrition Facts, , Dry Fruit Laddu Recipe (Naturally Sweetened), , , Amount Per Serving\t\t\t (1 dry fruit laddu), , , Calories, 99, , Calories from Fat 27, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 3g, 5%, Saturated Fat 1g, 6%, Sodium, 2mg, 0%, Potassium, 201mg, 6%, Carbohydrates, 19g, 6%, Fiber 3g, 13%, Sugar 14g, 16%, Protein, 2g, 4%, , , Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), 1mg, 67%, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), 1mg, 59%, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), 1mg, 5%, Vitamin B6, 1mg, 50%, Vitamin C, 1mg, 1%, Vitamin E, 1mg, 7%, Vitamin K, 2\u00b5g, 2%, Calcium, 27mg, 3%, Vitamin B9 (Folate), 5\u00b5g, 1%, Iron, 1mg, 6%, Magnesium, 27mg, 7%, Phosphorus, 44mg, 4%, Zinc, 1mg, 7%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , This dry fruit laddu recipe from the archives was first published in October 2013.
