        "Vegan custard": "Ingredients: , You can use it in, tarts, cakes, pastries, croissants, donuts, pancakes, , and many other desserts., , The best part?, You can flavor your vegan custard with vanilla, lemon, chocolate, pistachios, and more. Here, we\u2019ll show you how., , , Table of Contents, What is vegan custard?, How to make vegan custard, Tips and troubleshooting, Frequently asked questions, Flavor variations, Texture variations, Storage, Similar recipes, Vegan custard Recipe, , What is vegan custard?, , , Traditional custard, is thickened by the, coagulation of egg protein, and is made by combining egg yolks with milk, flour, and sugar., Our vegan version uses\u00a0cornstarch, as a thickening agent, , a tiny bit of\u00a0turmeric, for color, and\u00a0plant milk \u2013 such as soy, almond, or coconut \u2013 to replace dairy milk., , The best thing about this vegan custard recipe is that it\u2019s versatile and can be used in\u00a0many, vegan desserts, , such as our, vegan\u00a0apple cake, , zesty, lemon tart, ,\u00a0refreshing, fruit tart, , and summery, strawberry tart., , , It can also be used as a pastry cream to fill, doughnuts, and, croissants, or baked to make, custard pies., Finally, this, basic vegan custard recipe, In the variations section below, we show you how to make, coconut custard, , , lemon custard, , , chocolate custard, , , coffee custard, , and even, pistachio custard, ., , , , for vegan custard, , , , Quantities are in the, recipe, , box, at the bottom of the page., , Non-dairy milk, , We usually use, almond milk., , You can substitute your favorite, plant milk, such as soy, oat, or rice milk., , Add coconut milk, to make a more decadent and creamier vegan custard., , Cornstarch, , Cornstarch is our, thickening agent, , making the custard creamy., , Our quantities below will produce a, medium-thickness custard., , Reduce the cornstarch, if you want a more liquid custard, or add a little more if you want a thicker one., , You can replace cornstarch with, rice starch or potato starch, , although the texture of the pastry cream will be slightly different., , Sugar, , You can use, white or brown sugar, . Sugar is used for flavor, not for structure, so you can, substitute any other sweetener for it, ., , Try maple syrup, agave syrup, coconut sugar, or palm sugar., , Vanilla extract, , You can substitute the, seeds of a vanilla pod, for the extract., , Turmeric, , We recommend adding a, small amount of turmeric, \u20141/4 teaspoon for 2 cups of milk\u2014to give the milk a beautiful yellow color., , Don\u2019t add too much turmeric, ; your custard will turn an unappealing yellow-greenish color and taste of turmeric. You can replace turmeric with saffron powder., , Lemon peel, , Lemon peel is optional. If possible, use an organic lemon. Slice the peel with a, vegetable peeler, , add it to the milk, and remove it before serving the custard., , Avoid grating it, , as that will ruin the texture of the pastry cream., , It adds a wonderful lemon flavor to the custard. For even more lemon flavor, follow our, vegan lemon curd recipe., , , , How to make vegan custard, , , In a saucepan, off th, e heat, , :\u00a02 cups plant milk,\u00a01/3 cup sugar,\u00a01/2 cup cornstarch,\u00a01 teaspoon vanilla extract,\u00a01/4 teaspoon turmeric powder,\u00a0and\u00a0the peel of half a lemon., , Whisk until all lumps are gone, and the cornstarch is dissolved., , , Bring the pot to the stovetop and, stir continuously on medium heat, until the liquid thickens into a creamy custard., , Depending on the quantities, this can take, 2 to 5 minutes, ., , TIP:, To check if your custard is ready, dip a spoon or silicone spatula in it and run a finger through it. If the spatula stays clean, the custard is ready., , , When you have almost reached the consistency, you like, remove, the pan from the heat, and, fish out the lemon peel., , , Keep stirring for another minute, ., The custard will continue, thickening while off the heat., , , , , Tips and troubleshooting, , Cooling down, , If cooled down improperly, the vegan custard will dry on the surface, and the dry parts will create lumps. To avoid that, keep stirring while the custard cools down., The fastest and easiest way to do that is to fill your sink with cold water, submerge 3/4 of the pot, and stir for 5 minutes or until the custard is near room temperature., , Getting rid of lumps, , If your custard is lumpy, do not worry. There are two ways to fix it:, , , Whisk the custard vigorously. The fast whisking movement will remove the lumps, and the vegan custard will return to velvety creamy., , Blitz it up with an immersion blender. This will also remove the lumps, but the custard will be a little more liquid after blending., , , You can also use these two tricks if you reuse the custard after storing it in the refrigerator., , It will become thicker and gelatinous, so you\u2019ll need to blend or whisk it to make it creamy again., , , , Frequently asked questions, , Is custard gluten-free?, , Our vegan custard recipe is gluten-free as it\u2019s made with cornstarch, a thickener derived from corn., Corn is naturally gluten-free; however, some lower-quality brands might make their corn flour in a machine that has previously worked with wheat flour. So, if you want to be sure, check the label., , , What do you eat custard with?, , Custard can be eaten poured over fresh fruit, in cakes, tarts with lemon or strawberries, pies, croissants, doughnuts, Danish rolls, and more. It can also be eaten with a spoon., , , Can you freeze vegan custard?, , Yes, but we do not recommend freezing it. It takes longer to thaw than to make from scratch, and the taste won\u2019t be the same. You could, however, turn it into homemade vegan ice cream., To do this, place it in the freezer and blend it with an immersion blender every 30 minutes until it turns into smooth ice cream. It should take about three hours., You can also freeze the custard and blend it in a power blender or food processor after 3 hours. It\u2019s delicious!, , , Who invented custard?, , Believe it or not, custards have existed since, Ancient Rome, . I can definitely picture Marcus Aurelius dipping grapes in some freshly made Roman custard during his stoic meditations., , , , , , , Flavor variations, , Chocolate custard:, , Once the custard is almost ready, add your favorite brand of, vegan dark chocolate, , chopped with a knife,\u00a0off the heat. Stir for a minute, and enjoy!, , , Pistachio custard:, Roast the pistachio nuts first, then blend them with the plant milk until you have smooth pistachio milk., Add sugar, cornstarch, pistachio milk, and vanilla to a pot and proceed with our recipe., , , , Coffee custard, :, Add espresso or instant coffee to the plant milk, dissolve, and proceed with the recipe. This one does not contain lemon or turmeric., , , Lemon curd, is tangy, fresh, and packed with lemon flavor. It\u2019s a keeper for those who love lemons and tart flavors. This one is excellent for, vegan lemon bars, or, lemon tart, ., , , , Texture variations, , , Baked custard, : To make a great vegan baked custard, we recommend cooking it in a saucepan for about 2 minutes, then using it to fill a vegan pie shell, and then baking it in the oven for about 30 minutes., stirring continuously, and keep stirring on low heat until lightly thickened., , Pastry cream, , is\u00a0perfect for filling, vegan doughnuts, , , croissants, , , custard rolls, , , lemon cake, , or, vegan vanilla cake., , Classic pastry cream is generally vanilla-flavored, and does not contain lemon. To make it,, just cook the custard for longer., Boil it for about 3 minutes while stirring, then take it on low heat and keep stirring until you reach your desired consistency., , , , Storage, , , Make ahead:, You can make vegan custard in advance. If you do, cool it down to room temperature while whisking to prevent lumps from forming. Then, store it covered with plastic wrap, touching the custard., , Refrigerator:, Cool it to room temperature first, then store it in the fridge for 2 to 3 days. It\u2019s best to cover the custard with plastic wrap touching the custard., , Reheat:, Warm the custard on low heat by adding a dash of plant milk while stirring., Remove lumps:, During the cooling process, the custard may dry out on the surface, forming a thin skin that will result in annoying lumps., You can, blend the custard with an immersion blender, to remove lumps., , Freezing:, We do not recommend freezing the custard unless you want to make ice cream., , Similar recipes, , , Apple cake filled with custard, , Fruit tart, , Vegan lemon tart, , Brioche rolls with custard, , Strawberry tart, , Vegan Italian croissants, , Vanilla cake, , Sweet dough balls, , Apple fritters with custard, , Torta della nonna \u201cgrandma\u2019s custard pie\u201d, , , , Desserts, Vegan Apple Cake, Desserts, Vegan Lemon Tart, Desserts, Vegan lemon bars, Desserts, Fruit Tart, , , , , Vegan custard, , By:, Nico Pallotta, , 4.92, from, 97, votes, , Our vegan custard is a smooth, creamy, You can use it in tarts, cakes, pastries, croissants, donuts, pancakes, and many other desserts., , , , , , , , , Prep Time:, 5, minutes, , mins, Cook Time:, 5, minutes, , mins, Total Time:, 10, minutes, , mins, , , , , , Servings:, 6, , people, Course:, Dessert, Dressing & Sauces, Cuisine:, Italian, , , , , Pin, , Print, , Share, , , , , , Equipment, Whisk, , USA, Metric, For a low-fat lighter custard, \u25a2, 2, , cups, , plant-milk, , almond, oats, rice, or soy, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cups, , cornstarch, \u25a2, \u2153, , cups, , sugar, \u25a2, \u215b, , teaspoon, , turmeric, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , vanilla extract, \u25a2, \u00bd, , lemon, , only the peel, For a full-fat richer custard, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , plant-milk, , almond, oats, rice, or soy, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , coconut milk, , the one that comes in a can, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cups, , cornstarch, \u25a2, \u2153, , cups, , sugar, \u25a2, \u215b, , teaspoon, , turmeric, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , vanilla extract, , Cook Mode, Prevent your screen from going dark, , 2 cups, plant-milk, , , \u00bd cups, cornstarch, , , \u2153 cups, sugar, , , \u215b teaspoon, turmeric, , , 1 teaspoon, vanilla extract, , and the peel of, \u00bd, lemon, ., Whisk until all lumps are gone., Tip:, Peel the lemon with a vegetable peeler., , Whisk on medium heat, until the liquid thickens into a, creamy, , custard, ., It can take between, 2 to 5 minutes, , depending on the quantities., Tip:, To check if your custard is ready, dip a spoon in the custard, then run a finger through it (careful it's hot).

        "Vegan Ganache": "Ingredients: , , vegan butter, , vegan chocolate, , , Now for vegan ganache, we\u2019re making this entirely coconut free. But guess what? You can also make this ganache entirely Paleo friendly, keto friendly, and nut-free., , , , I go over my specific vegan butter options down below in the recipe card (where you\u2019ll find the full written recipe, along with measurements). There are some vegan butters that are Paleo friendly, and others that are nut-free., , In terms of making this a sugar free chocolate ganache, the key is using sugar free chocolate. I like to use Lily\u2019s Sweets, which is stevia-sweetened, Keto diet, )., , When I say that this vegan ganache takes only 2 minutes, I truly mean it. You\u2019ll simply need to do the following:, , , Heat the vegan butter until hot., , Add in the chocolate chips., , Stir until melted., , Allow the ganache to come to room temperature according to how you\u2019ll use it., , , , First, melt the butter in a microwave safe bowl until hot., , Then add in the chocolate chips. Let them sit for 30 seconds before mixing., , , , Begin to mix the chocolate into the butter until completely melted., , Then your chocolate ganache is ready to go!, , , How to use ganache in recipes, , Once you\u2019ve made your vegan ganache, you can use it an array of recipes!, , My favorite way to use ganache is as a vegan chocolate drip to a cake, such as my, vegan Black Forest Cake, and my, vegan Buche de Noel, . It\u2019s also wonderful to add as a filling to vegan cupcakes., , For using as a drip for cakes, , you\u2019ll absolutely need to make sure that the ganache is not piping hot, as it will immediately melt your vegan buttercream. That would be so sad! Give the ganache a few minutes to cool, or pop it into the fridge to cool faster (just not too long or it will harden!)., , For integrating into a chocolate buttercream,, you\u2019ll need to again allow the ganache to come down to room temperature for a bit, or it will melt the vegan butter.

This was meant to be a quick & easy recipe that\u2019s hassle free AND approachable for people who are new to vegan baking (especially those who have just switched to being vegan). Normal ganache is made with chocolate and cream, not butter; however, coconut cream is often too thick (high in fat) for a smooth and glossy vegan chocolate ganache. So I use vegan butter instead, which yields a really similar result that\u2019s still approachable. Sometimes recipes are extensive (like my gluten-free recipes!) and other times, in my opinion, SHOULDN\u2019T be complicated, as more often than not, it\u2019s used as a component for another recipe that you\u2019re making (ie. a wedding cake- who needs a super complex recipe to make ON TOP of a wedding cake ha!).

I find it\u2019s a bit fluffier if you use the heavy vegan cream in place of the vegan butter if you\u2019re going to whip the ganache, but it will work with the vegan butter!

        "Vegan berry panna cotta": "Ingredients: \ud83e\udd58 Equipment, , This vegan panna cotta is a delicious, creamy, , Full-fat coconut cream, is the star of this recipe, providing the rich, creamy texture that is characteristic of traditional panna cotta. It is important to use full-fat coconut cream for the best results., , Almond milk, is the perfect dairy-free alternative to traditional milk. It adds a hint of nutty flavor and helps to achieve the right consistency for the panna cotta., , Cornstarch, is the binding agent we use to make this delicate dessert vegan. This is a great alternative to agar-agar which is too strong to make panna cotta perfectly., , Granulated sugar, and, vanilla extract, are essential for sweetening and flavor. You can also use other alternative sweeteners like agave or maple syrup., , Frozen mixed berries, are the main ingredient for the mixed berry sauce. They add a sweet and tart flavor that compliments the richness of the panna cotta perfectly., , \ud83d\uded2, ., , , , \ud83e\udd58 Equipment, , For this vegan panna cotta recipe, a good quality saucepan is essential for heating and combining the coconut cream, dairy-free milk, and sugar, as well as for preparing the mixed berry sauce. I recommend using a heavy-bottom saucepan, which helps to distribute the heat evenly and prevents the mixture from scorching., , , , , STEP 1, Shake the can of coconut milk to ensure it is well mixed. Then, in a saucepan, warm up the full-fat coconut milk and sugar over medium heat., , STEP 2, While the coconut milk and sugar are heating up, mix the dairy-free milk and cornstarch in a small bowl. Ensure that the cornstarch is fully dissolved in the milk., , , , Making the vegan panna cotta, , STEP 1, Once the sugar has dissolved in the coconut milk, , STEP 2, Continue to cook this mixture over medium heat until the cornstarch is activated and the cream has thickened. This should take about 10 minutes. The consistency you are looking for is similar to a slow-flowy paste., , , , , STEP 3, After the cream has thickened, add the vanilla extract to the mixture. Stir well to ensure that the vanilla is evenly distributed., , STEP 4, Pour the panna cotta mixture into serving bowls. I recommend using \u2153 cup for each serving. Allow the panna cotta to cool to room temperature before placing it in the refrigerator to set., , , , , Making the mixed berries sauce, , STEP 1, In a saucepan, combine the mixed berries, water, and coconut sugar. Bring this mixture to a boil., , STEP 2, Once the berries have softened, use an immersion blender to blend them into a sauce. If you do not have an immersion blender, you can transfer the mixture to a regular blender., , , , , , STEP 3, After blending the berries, , STEP 4, Continue to cook the sauce until it thickens to a slow-flowy consistency. This should take about 10 minutes. Once the panna cotta has set, serve it with the mixed berries sauce. Enjoy your vegan panna cotta with mixed berries sauce!, , , , , \ud83d\udca1 Expert tip, , The key to achieving a smooth and creamy vegan panna cotta is to mix your dairy-free milk and cornstarch in a separate bowl before adding it to your warm coconut milk. This simple step prevents lumps from forming in your mixture, giving you a silky-smooth dessert., , , , \ud83d\udd04 Variations, , Try a, salt and caramel, twist on this classic recipe. A quick vegan caramel can be made by melting \u00bd cup of coconut sugar and a 14-oz can of full-fat coconut milk in a saucepan. Make sure you have sea salt flakes (fleur-de-sel), not regular salt, to make this delicious sauce. Add \u00bd tsp and check for the flavor. It will give your panna cotta a unique, sweet, and salty flavor that pairs perfectly with the creamy coconut., , Fresh mango puree, is a perfect addition for a refreshing twist. Simply peel, slice, fruity flavor to your vegan panna cotta., , If you are a fan of tangy flavors, consider adding a, fresh berry sauce, . Instead of cooking the berries, blend fresh berries with a little bit of sugar and lemon juice. You can also try my, strawberry sauce, recipe., , , , , \ud83e\udd63 Serving ideas, , Vegan panna cotta is a versatile and delicious dessert that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. I love serving them with a generous drizzle of mixed berry sauce. The vibrant colors and sweet-tart flavor of the berries complement the creamy panna cotta beautifully., , You can also serve them with a dollop of coconut whipped cream and a sprinkle of toasted coconut flakes for a tropical twist. This not only adds a lovely coconut flavor but also a bit of crunch, making each bite even more enjoyable., , Another great option is to serve them with a variety of fresh berries. I like to place a few strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries on top of each panna cotta. This not only adds a pop of color but also a refreshing burst of flavor., , If you\u2019re a fan of citrus flavors, you can also serve them with a citrus compote. The bright, tangy flavors of oranges, lemons, and limes are a perfect match for the creamy panna cotta., , , , \u2744\ufe0f Storing tips, , Storing and reheating this vegan panna cotta is a simple process that can help maintain its creamy texture and delicious flavors., , To, store, it, you will need to place it in an airtight container and refrigerate. It can stay fresh in the refrigerator for two to three days. However, it is important to note that the panna cotta will start to set more firmly the longer it is in the fridge., , I do not recommend, freezing, this dessert. The creamy texture of the panna cotta, which is achieved through the use of coconut cream and dairy-free milk, can be altered by the freezing and thawing process., , , , \ud83e\udd14 FAQs, , , , , Can you use other fruits for the sauce?, , , Absolutely, you can use any type of berry you have on hand, such as blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, or a combination of these. You can also use frozen fruit without the need to thaw it. Just add it to the pan and follow the recipe., , , , , What kind of dairy-free milk can you use?, , , I recommend using unsweetened almond milk or, cashew milk, for this recipe. Other nut milks may have a strong nutty flavor that could overpower the panna cotta. The same is true for oat milk and soy milk, as they have distinct characteristics. If you prefer a hint of coconut flavor, you can also use light coconut milk., , , , , , , More vegan pudding-like recipes, , Purple Sweet Potato Chocolate Pudding (Vegan, Paleo), Light Vegan Custard Tart, The Creamiest Vegan Rice Pudding (8 Flavor Variations!), Vegan Tapioca Pudding, , , THANK YOU, so much for visiting our website.

If you add a thickener to hot liquid, you will get lumps. Alternatively, since an eggless panna cotta doesn\u2019t really need cooking, , Add vanilla extract after it has thickened, \u2013 If you want to capture the vanilla aroma, we recommend adding it at the last minute. If you add it in the first step and it is heated even for like 5-10 minutes, vanilla extract loses all its aroma. So if you end up with a more coconutty panna cotta, you probably added vanilla extract too early., , What if it is not thick enough?, \u2013 Cornstarch needs high heat to be activated. If you don\u2019t heat it high enough or long enough, you may end up with a custard texture instead of a panna cotta texture. You will not be able to turn it out of silicone molds., , Cool it down before placing it in the fridge, \u2013 Cool them first on the kitchen counter and only place them in the refrigerator when they are not hot to the touch anymore. If you place them hot in the fridge, condensation might appear at the top., , , Top 3 panna cotta flavors, , , Berry Sauce Instructions: \ud83d\udca1 Expert tip, \ud83d\udd04 Variations, \ud83e\udd63 Serving ideas, \u2744\ufe0f Storing tips, \ud83e\udd14 FAQs, More vegan pudding-like recipes, Vegan Panna Cotta (Way Better Than With Agar Agar!), , , \u2764\ufe0f Why you\u2019ll love it, , I love this vegan panna cotta recipe.

(This will also depend on your personal preference on how thick you like your chia pudding.), , If you use all, coconut milk, to make chia pudding, you may need a bit more since it is a thicker liquid., , , Tips for making this recipe perfectly, , Use a mix of, coconut milk, and almond milk in this recipe, .

You only want to melt the gelatin., , , , , , , , Make and Heat Mango Mixture, , , , , To the gelatin mixture, add white sugar, coconut milk, and pur\u00e9ed mango. Give it a stir until smooth and well combined., , , , , Transfer mango mixture to a small pot. On medium-low heat, whisk until gelatin has melted and fully dissolved, about 3-4 minutes. The mixture should be completely smooth with a creamy texture., Do not bring pudding mixture to a simmer/boil or have it bubbling., (If you're using agar agar powder, bring it to a boil to activate the powder and remove off heat immediately)., , , , Refrigerate Mixture in Bowls or Molds, , , , , Pour mixture into four greased serving bowls, bowls or silicone molds.

Defrost in the fridge or at room temperature and once it's jiggly, it's ready to enjoy!, , , , , Pairing Suggestions, , Mango pudding is best enjoyed on its own with evaporated milk to balance out the sweet flavors with the creamy milk. But you can serve this dessert with whipped cream, fresh fruit, served over shaved ice with condensed milk, diced and mixed into a chilled coconut beverage with ice and more!, , , , FAQ, , Can I make mango pudding in advance?, , Yes, this can easily be made 1-2 days before and stored in an airtight container in the fridge until you're ready to serve it chilled., , , Can I use frozen mangoes?, , I highly recommend using fresh mangoes as they're easier to blend into a smooth pur\u00e9e and most of the time, they're sweeter. But if you only have access to frozen mangoes, then it'll work but it just may not be as sweet., , , How can I make this vegan?, , Substitute the gelatine powder with 1.5 teaspoon agar agar powder. You can find agar-agar powder at select grocers or online on Amazon., , , How can I make this dairy-free?, , If you're dairy-free, substitute the evaporated milk with canned evaporated coconut milk.

I love making this in the microwave for a quick treat.

Transfer the mixture to the prepared pudding basin., To steam the pudding, Cut a large square of greaseproof paper and another of foil, both slightly bigger than the basin. Place the foil over the paper and make a 2.5cm/1in thick fold in the centre of both layers. Place on top of the pudding basin, paper-side down, and fasten securely with a piece of string around the basin, under the lip., Tie another piece to this one, run it across the top of the basin and tie the other end to the string on the opposite side of the basin to create a handle, so that you can easily lift the pudding out of the pan., Place a trivet or upturned saucer at the bottom of the large pan and place the pudding basin on top. Fill the pan with hot water, so that it comes about two-thirds of the way up the pudding basin. Cover the pot with a lid and bring to a gentle simmer, then let it steam for 31\u20442 hours, checking occasionally and topping up the water if needed so it doesn\u2019t boil dry., After 31\u20442 hours, lift the pudding out of the pan and leave to cool for a few minutes, until the pudding starts to shrink away from the basin. Carefully, using a palette knife, loosen the pudding from the sides and turn over onto a plate., To serve, Make the quick chocolate sauce. Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water and add a few drops of milk to loosen it into a pourable consistency. Pour over the pudding, to serve., , , , Notes, , , You can store the pudding in its basin and covered with foil, for up to a year in a cool dark place.

Did you definitely add the hot water to the mixture? I recall a reader did this before last Christmas. The mixture should definitely be wet before you put it into the basin. So if you try it again, make sure you've added the water and if you have, maybe add a drop or two more until you have more of a batter consistency.

But too much liquid will result in a soggy pudding. This is just enough for the fruit to absorb the flavour without too much moisture. It will absorb more liquid as it cooks and be nice and plump and juicy for the end result., , , Reply, , , , , , \u00ab Older Comments, Primary Sidebar, , , , I'm Aimee, , the author behind the Wallflower Kitchen blog and 'Great British Vegan' cookbook, , More about me \u2192, , , Trending recipes, , Baked Bubble & Squeak Cakes, Creamy Vegan Mushroom Risotto, Easy Vegan French Toast, Footer, , \u2191 back to top, , , , About, , , Privacy Policy, , About, , , , , Contact, , , Contact me, , , , Pinterest, , RSS Feed, , YouTube, , , , , As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

Looks like you nailed it and cannot believe it\u2019s all made with dates too\u2026.um, again, date queen strikes again! I personally just think that Medjool Dates Natural Delights should rename their company to Natalie the Date Queen because nobody does date desserts better than you, hahaha! Seriously, even that toffee  pudding looks so creamy and amazing! And again, you made coconut flour look appetizing and not obviously coconut flour.

Another make-ahead question: if I don\u2019t want to compromise the texture, how should I best do this? Bake then freeze then defrost then microwave on the day to serve? Or reheat in the oven (from defrosted or frozen)? Or make the batter ahead and try to bake at my in-laws on the day? Sorry, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Natalie, , says, , , November 22, 2018 at 8:59 am, , , , Baked goods are just never the same after freezing and reheating, especially healthier recipes like this unfortunately, but I think defrosting slowly and then reheating in the oven will be your best bet!

I\u2019m a chocoholic, but I don\u2019t feel at all deprived having these\u2014they are so flavorful I don\u2019t miss the chocolate.  Both the pudding and the sauce are wondrous.  I had some dates that needed to be used up, so what a terrific way to do that\u2014and have a healthy, unique, uber-flavorful dessert.  We even bought a mini bundt cake tray for this, which I don\u2019t regret, since this will be a frequent repeater.

I\u2019ve never used dates before and the natural sweetness is amazing! I subbed the coconut for a little less than a 1/4 cup of oat flour and then added a little more tapioca starch.

If I have to make this vegetarian and NOT vegan, can I do 1-1 replacement of coconut milk with dairy milk, coconut flour with all purpose flour and cashew butter with normal butter?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Natalie, , says, , , August 27, 2020 at 8:28 am, , , , Hi Nikita! The regular milk should be fine although I\u2019d recommend something higher in fat like whole milk. Coconut flora for AP will not work unfortunately, coconut flour is VERY dry compared to normal flour so you will need quite a bit more normal flour to make that sub and I can\u2019t say for sure how much without testing it. And the regular butter melts unlike cashew butter so again can\u2019t say how that will affect the texture of the cake\u2013could work, idk.

My non-vegan and super hard to please brother and dad loved it as well- my brother is especially scornful of \u2018healthy\u2019 desserts but he ate every mouthful!

I made half of the recipe, used iranian dates, and used tahini instead of cashew butter. I also didnt have coconut flour, so i added an extra teaspoon of cornstarch and then used oat flour (twice as much in weight as the recipe says for coconut flour). I basically just added the oatflour until it reached a cake like consistency. I baked this for about 25 minutes, since it was smaler.I made it in a round cake pan and it was perfect. I was not able to make the sauce since I ran out of dates, so I made a basic sauce with milk and sugar. I didnt have vanilla so i just added a bit of cinnamon for some flavour, but vanilla would be great. I also soaked the dates in coffee. I definitely recommend this recipe. It\u2019s really lovely flavours (if you like tahini) and just so lovely.

        "Vegan chcocolate ganache": "Ingredients: , For years I have made chocolate ganache because I love how incredibly rich and smooth it is. Who doesn\u2019t love heavy cream and chocolate?\u00a0I don\u2019t eat dairy all the time anymore and it is something so many people have allergies or sensitivities to so I wanted to make my favorite chocolate ganache frosting vegan., , Full-fat coconut milk is really one of the only dairy-free milks that has enough fat to really compare to heavy cream so I knew that it would be my best bet in replicating some creamy chocolate ganache frosting., , This recipe really is incredibly simple and the only hard part is waiting for it all to set so you can whip it in to frosting., , How to Make Vegan Ganache Frosting, , , You want to heat the full-fat coconut milk (I usually use a double boiler) and then take it off the heat and pour in the chopped chocolate or chips., , , Let is bathe in the warm milk for a couple mins and then starting in the middle you slowly start whisking the mixture until it becomes a gloriously creamy batch of melted chocolate., , , , Then you wait\u2026., , , You want to let the vegan chocolate ganache cool to room temperature (stirring the mixture occasionally) and then place it in the refrigerator to set. This usually takes around 3 hours (womp womp). You want the chocolate ganache to be firm but still soft enough to scoop out., , , After that, you just scoop the vegan chocolate ganache out and put it in a stand mixer bowl (or you can use a hand mixer) and you want to use the paddle attachment to basically beat air in to the ganache to create a creamy chocolate ganache frosting. Start off slow and then work your way up and beat until the frosting is smooth and creamy., , , Just remember\u2026chocolate melts so you don\u2019t necessarily want to handle the ganache frosting a lot or over beat it., , , Then you can spread this deliciously perfect vegan chocolate ganache frosting on with a spatula or pipe it. You can serve it while it is still soft and creamy or you can let it set some (like the cupcakes in my images)., , , , P.S. \u2013 I usually use my, Gluten-free Double Chocolate Chip Muffins, for my cupcake base. I just omit the chocolate chips and add 2 teaspoons of vanilla., , FAQ\u2019S and TIPS for Vegan Ganache Frosting, , What kind of chocolate should I use?, , Use a high quality chocolate. Ganache frosting is not something you want to use cheap chocolate on because it is the main ingredient. I usually prefer around a 70% but do what grade of chocolate your personally prefer. You can use chocolate chips or coarsely chop a chocolate bar, , Do I use canned coconut milk or the kind found in the carton?, , This step is really important. Make sure your coconut milk has a lot of fat. The best way to test it is to shake the can. If the whole thing doesn\u2019t slosh around with milk it means there is a good chunk of coconut cream in the can (usually on the top). Unfortunately, the coconut milk found in the large cartons does not have enough fat to make this ganache frosting., , Does it matter if I put the chocolate ganache in the refrigerator while still warm?, , Yes, putting the ganache in the refrigerator before it cools down can create too much condensation and you won\u2019t get the right texture. You want to avoid any condensation on the chocolate ganache when it is cooling. That is why you bring it to room temp before sticking it in the fridge. Also, don\u2019t cover it. More than likely condensation will form on your plastic wrap and drip on to your ganache frosting., , Is dark chocolate Vegan?, , There are a lot of options out there for vegan dark chocolate but just be sure to read the labels on the back. Typically dairy is found milk chocolate., , How should\u00a0I store the Vegan Ganache Frosting if I am not using it right away?, , You will want to store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If you need to pipe or spread the frosting I would let it sit out on the counter for about 20 minutes and then beat it in your mixer again to fluff up the ganache frosting., , , , , , , , , , Print, , clock, , clock icon, cutlery, , cutlery icon, flag, , flag icon, folder, , folder icon, instagram, , instagram icon, pinterest, , pinterest icon, facebook, , facebook icon, print, , print icon, squares, , squares icon, heart, , heart icon, heart solid, , heart solid icon, , , , , , , Vegan Chocolate Ganache Frosting, , , , , , , , , , , 5 Stars, , , , , , , , , 4 Stars, , , , , , , , , 3 Stars, , , , , , , , , 2 Stars, , , , , , , , , 1 Star, , , , No reviews, , , , , , , Author:, , Jessi\u2019s Kitchen, , , Prep Time:, , 10, , , Total Time:, , 4.5, , , Yield:, , 2 cups, , 1, x, , , , , , , Print Recipe, , , , , Pin Recipe, , , , , , , , , , Description, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Scale, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , , , 1, can full-fat coconut milk (approx., 1.5 cups, ), , 10oz, chocolate chips (or coarsely chopped chocolate), , , , , , , , , , , , Cook Mode, , Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , , , , ,  Instructions: , , , , Heat coconut milk over a double broiler or in the microwave (I prefer double broiler)., , Once hot, remove from the heat and add the chocolate.

Approximately 3 hours (preferably longer if you have the time). You want the chocolate ganache to be firm but still soft enough to scoop out., , Once set, scoop the chocolate ganache out and put it in a stand mixer bowl (or you can use a hand mixer) and use the paddle attachment to beat air in to the ganache to create a creamy chocolate ganache frosting. Start off slow and then work your way up and beat until the frosting is smooth and creamy., , You can spread the creamy frosting with an offset spatula or use a piping bag., , , , , , , Notes, , , , Use a good quality chocolate. I usually prefer around a 70% but do what grade of chocolate your personally prefer. You can use chips or coarsely chop a chocolate bar, , Be sure to weigh your chocolate with a, kitchen scale, to make sure you have the right amount., , Make sure your coconut milk has a lot of fat. The best way to test it is to shake the can. If the whole thing doesn\u2019t slosh around with milk it means there is a good chunk of coconut cream in the can (usually on the top)., , You want to avoid any condensation on the chocolate ganache when it is cooling. That is why you bring it to room temp before sticking it in the fridge. Also, don\u2019t cover it. More than likely condensation will form on your plastic wrap., , Chocolate melts so you don\u2019t necessarily want to handle the ganache a lot or over beat it., , , , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, , Tag, @jessiskitchen, on Instagram and hashtag it, #jessiskitchen, , , , , , , , , , Don\u2019t miss out!, , , , , , , , Previous Post:, \u00ab Gluten-free Butternut Squash Muffins, Next Post:, Oat Flour Chocolate Zucchini Cake \u00bb, Reader Interactions, Comments, , , , , , Shannon Trindade, , says, , , June 23, 2020 at 5:54 pm, , , , This looks amazing!

So I have not tried it but in theory it should work. You would need to thaw it in the fridge overnight and probably leave it out at room temperature before spreading it. If mixture is not spreading well I would recommend whipping it in the mixer again. Let me know if you try it., , , , , , , , , Simone, , says, , , January 6, 2021 at 11:14 am, , , , I made this today with a good can of coconut milk and semi-sweet non dairy chocolate chips. I let it cool for an hour on the counter and then 2 hours in the fridge in a thin metal bowl. It looked firm, but must not have been firm enough. It didn\u2019t whip up nicely like yours and was pretty liquid. I ended up pouring it over my cake. Mostly just a warning to others that 3 hours is a minimum fridge time!  I probably won\u2019t make it again. Mine tasted kinda like watery chocolate pudding to me\u2026, , , , , , , , , Jessi's Kitchen, , says, , , January 6, 2021 at 1:06 pm, , , , I am so sorry the recipe didn\u2019t work for you. The recipe does recommend you let it set in the refrigerator for 3 hours to chill. I am guessing it needed to chill more or the coconut milk did not contain enough fat. It is also important that you weigh the chocolate to ensure you have the right amount. Hope you were still able to enjoy your cake. Thanks for the feedback., , , , , , , , , Mara, , says, , , January 25, 2021 at 5:38 pm, , , , This worked perfectly with a can of coconut cream. Thanks for the recipe. I made sure to only use the fat and drain out the liquid., , , , , , , , , Jessi's Kitchen, , says, , , January 26, 2021 at 12:49 pm, , , , Yay! So glad it turned out well and that you enjoyed it., , , , , , , , , abby, , says, , , May 2, 2023 at 8:02 pm, , , , no lie, I\u2019ve been making this as a \u2018mousse\u2019 & topping it with faintly-sweetened coconut cream and berries. Obsessed., , , , , , , , , Jessi's Kitchen, , says, , , May 22, 2023 at 4:53 pm, , , , Yesss! I have done the same thing. Glad you love it., , , , , , , , , Ash, , says, , , September 6, 2024 at 6:59 am, , , , Does this need to be refrigerated, since it\u2019s non dairy? I want to leave it frosted on a cake at room temperature for my son\u2019s birthday party. PS my kids and husband loved my practice vegan ganache frosting batch so much!, , , , , , , , , Jessi's Kitchen, , says, , , September 10, 2024 at 9:10 am, , , , So it can stay out for a while at room temperature. But if it is overly warm it can start to melt since the base has so much chocolate in it. But as long as your room isn\u2019t overly warm it can stay out for a couple hours usually. Hope your son has a great birthday!, , , , , , , Leave a Reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, , , Recipe rating, , , , , , , , , 5 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 4 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 3 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 2 Stars, , , , , , , , , , 1 Star, , , , , Comment, *, , Name, , , Email, , , Website, , , , , , \u0394, , , Primary Sidebar, Hello!, , Hey there!
