        "Chocolate Almond Butter Bars": "Ingredients: , , I absolutely love nut butter treats like these, chocolate peanut butter cookie dough bites, and this, chocolate peanut butter fudge, . I usually go for peanut butter, but these almond butter squares are just as delicious!, , These are so good that I have a hard time stopping myself from eating too many at once!, , These Chocolate Almond Butter Bars Are:, , Vegan, Gluten-free, No-Bake, Absolutely delectable!, , , , For the almond butter base:, , 1 \u00bd cups all-natural almond butter (almonds should be the only ingredient listed on the container), \u00bd cup pure maple syrup, 2 tablespoons cacao powder, 140 grams fine almond flour (about 1 + \u00bc cups), , For the chocolate top:, , \u00be cups vegan chocolate chips, 2 tablespoons all-natural almond butter, , It is very important that the almond butter you use is natural because it has a different texture from the ones that have added salt, sugar, oil, etc., , How to Make, , First, ensure that you have the correct almond butter for this recipe. It has to be natural, which means it has no added salt, sugar, oil, or anything other than just almonds. All natural nut butter has a much wetter texture, which is necessary for this recipe., , Once you\u2019ve ensured that your almond butter is ready, add it to a bowl with the maple syrup and cacao powder. Mix together., , Next, add the almond flour and mix. You will need to use your hands because the dough is quite thick., , , , , , , Press this dough into an 8 x 8 pan lined with parchment paper, then place it in the fridge for 15 minutes., , , , , , After chilling the dough, melt the chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of almond butter together in the microwave. One minute should be enough time. Spread this melted chocolate mixture over the dough in the pan. Place in the fridge to set for 2 hours., , Cut into 16 squares and enjoy!, , , , Tips, , If your almond butter has a lot of oil on top and is very firm underneath, it may be hard to mix. When this happens, I empty the jar into a food processor and blend until the almond butter is evenly mixed., Mix the bottom layer of these chocolate almond butter bars very well to eliminate pieces of cacao powder. It may take awhile to get all of the cacao powder completely blended, but it will incorporate if you keep mixing., Weighing your almond flour is best. If you use too much almond flour, these chocolate almond butter bars will be too crumbly, but if you don\u2019t use enough, they will be very soft and won\u2019t hold their shape well. This is why it\u2019s best to use a food scale to weigh your almond flour., Don\u2019t skip the added almond butter for the chocolate layer. Adding 2 tablespoons of almond butter to the melted chocolate chips ensures that the chocolate layer is not too hard once it chills. If you just spread on melted chocolate, it will be very hard and breakable once it sets., , Storing, These Almond Butter Bars, , Store these chocolate almond butter bars in a container in the fridge. They won\u2019t hold up as well at room temperature because they will soften., , You can freeze these chocolate almond butter bars as well. I suggest layering parchment paper between the bars before freezing. When you\u2019re ready to eat them, simply thaw the bars in a container in the fridge., , , More Vegan Dessert Recipes, , Check out these other delicious vegan treats:, , Chocolate Peanut Butter Stuffed Dates, Chickpea Cookie Dough, Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, Sweet Potato Chocolate Pudding, Banana Chocolate Chip Mug Cake, , Recipe, , , , Print Recipe, , , Chocolate Almond Butter Bars (No-Bake), , , These no-bake chocolate almond butter bars are vegan and gluten-free. They are absolutely delicious and a great indulgent snack or dessert, , , , Course:, Dessert, Cuisine:, plant-based, Vegan, , Servings:, 16, , bars, , Calories:, 277, kcal, , Author:, Bree Sheree, , Base, *1 \u00bd cups natural almond butter, , (no added sugar, salt, or oil), \u00bd, , cup, , maple syrup, 2, , tablespoons, , cacao powder, **140 grams fine almond flour, , (1 + \u00bc cups), Top, \u00be, , cups, , vegan chocolate chips, 2, , tablespoons, , natural almond butter, , (no added sugar, salt, or oil), , so mix it in evenly before measuring out your almond butter. If it\u2019s difficult to mix because the almond butter is hard under the oil, empty the container into a food processor and blend the almond butter before measuring., , **I suggest weighing your almond flour to ensure you have the correct amount. I have given cup measurements as well, but there can be a big difference based on how you fill your measuring cup. Too much flour will make these bars too crumbly and too little will make them too soft., , After cutting the bars, place them in a sealed container and store in the fridge.

Continue mixing until all of the cacao powder is fully mixed in., Add the almond flour and mix. It will be easiest to use your hands because the dough is quite thick., Once the dough is evenly mixed, line an 8 x 8 inch square pan with parchment paper and press the dough into it evenly. Chill this in the fridge for 15 minutes., Once the dough has chilled, add the chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of almond butter to a bowl and microwave for 30 seconds. Check if it\u2019s melted by mixing with a spoon. Continue microwaving for 30 second intervals until you can stir the chocolate chips into smooth melted chocolate., Pour this chocolate mix over the dough base and spread it out evenly. Place the pan back in the fridge for two hours before cutting and eating the squares., , , Notes",
        "Vegan Key Lime Pie Bars": "Ingredients: , , For the crust you will need:, , , Whole raw cashews, , Dates, , Almond flour, , Cinnamon, , Vanilla extract, , Sea salt., , , The dates give the crust its sweetness and break down when added to a food processor to form a sticky sweet crust. The pinch of sea salt helps to balance out the sweetness for the perfect flavor., , A Perfect Sweet Yet Tart Vegan Key Lime Filling, , , These bars get their creamy texture from whole cashews! When soaked and blended, they create a delicious filling that tastes like key lime pie., , Here is what you\u2019ll need for the key lime filling:, , Soaked Cashews:, , Let your whole cashews soak overnight in water to get that perfect creamy texture., , Full Fat Coconut Milk:, , Use canned full fat coconut to help give the filling the right amount of creaminess., , Lime Juice:, , Of course, you can\u2019t have key lime pie without fresh lime juice. The amount of lime juice depends on how tart you like your key lime pie. I like to start with \u00bc a cup and add an additional \u00bc cup at a time until it\u2019s the desired tartness you prefer. Usually \u00bc a cup to \u00bd a cup of lime juice should do the trick., , Maple Syrup:, , These bars are naturally sweetened with pure maple syrup. Feel free to use a bit more if you like things on the sweeter side., , Vanilla Extract:, , An obvious addition that adds just the right amount of maple flavor., , Coconut Oil:, , Coconut oil helps to solidify the bars once cooled., , How to Make These Easy Key Lime Pie Bars, , Step One:, , The first step in making these key lime pie bars is to soak the cashews in water overnight. Soaking the cashews helps to soften them and gives the key lime filling a nice creamy texture., , If you do not have time to soak the cashews overnight, you can pour boiling hot water over them and let the cashews soak for\u00a0 three to four hours until tender. The filling might not be as smooth and creamy, but it will still work., , Step Two:, , , Use your fingers to press the dough into an 8\u00d78 baking pan that has been lined with parchment paper. Put the crust in the fridge or freezer while you prepare the key lime filling., , , Step Three:, , Add the soaked cashews, lime juice, lime zest, maple syrup, coconut oil, coconut milk, and vanilla extract to your food process or high powered blender. Blend the filling until silky smooth and creamy. You want to make sure that there are no lumps or bits of cashew remaining in the filling., , Next, give the filling a taste and adjust it based on your tastes. This is the perfect time to add more lime juice if you like your key lime pie to be more tart or add more maple syrup if you want the bars to be a bit sweeter., , Step Four:, , Once the filling tastes how you want it to taste, pour it over the prepared crust crust., , , Step Five:, , Freeze the key lime pie bars overnight or until completely solid. When you are ready to serve, remove the bars from the freezer and sprinkle with a little extra lime zest. Then, use a sharp knife to slice the bars into 9 or 16 pieces. Serve and enjoy!, , Tips, Tricks, and Storage Details, , These bars are incredibly easy to make but here are a few of my favorite tips and tricks to make sure that they come out absolutely perfect every time!, , , Use fresh lime juice! The bottled shelf-stable stuff is not going to work for this recipe., , Do not forget to remove the pits from your dates before adding them to the food processor., , Do not over process the crust. It should be sticky, similar to a cookie dough, not smooth like a nut butter., , Let the bars freeze until they are completely solid before slicing. It will be tempting to dive in right away but freezing them until firm makes the bars much easier to slice., , Store these bars in the freezer. I like to freeze them completely and then add them to a storage bag.

        "Creamy vegan lemon bars": "Ingredients: , , naturally sweetened,, and, gluten-free, ! I know, I\u2019m excited, too., The almond-oat crust is adapted from my, Peanut Butter and Jelly Snack Bars, , and somehow ends up tasting reminiscent of graham cracker crust! It\u2019s my new favorite thing, besides this \u00fcber creamy filling., The filling is comprised of soaked cashews, coconut cream, lots of lemon juice + zest, maple syrup, arrowroot starch (for thickening), and sea salt. That\u2019s it!, I didn\u2019t know what would happen if I blended it all up and baked it, but it turns out, , it ends up tasting like a lemon bar with a cheesecake-like texture, . SWOON!, Friends, you\u2019re going to LOVE these bars! They\u2019re:, Creamy, Rich, Lemony, Not too\u00a0sweet, Simple, Surprisingly healthy, Portable, & Delicious, These would make the perfect dessert for so many things: Bridal showers (I know), baby showers (I know!), study dates (yass girl), office gatherings (the least exciting, but still really cool).

You likely won\u2019t need quite as much (we\u2019d suggest trying 3/4 cup). Hope that helps!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Erin Contour, , says, , , August 20, 2024 at 8:32 pm, , , , I made this using substitutions since I didn\u2019t have what I thought I did. I substituted Organic Rolled Oats with Ancient Grains & Seeds instead of the oatmeal and Blanched Almond Flour instead of almonds (3/4 c flour rather than 1 c almonds, had to guess about that). Figured they were going to get ground up anyway so the flour should work. These two substitutions resulted in a crust that was drier than I would have liked (the cereal mix had chia seeds which could definitely have sucked up moisture) but they worked in that I achieved a crust that was tolerably crumbly and held together. I am OK with the flavor but sure the straight oatmeal would be better and ditto with the almonds. The flour is a less flavorful., , When I blended the lemon mixture I did double the zest trying to increase the lemon flavor. It\u2019s there, , I did do something with my blender that I often do making vegan sour cream etc. and that is to blend on soup mode which both blends and heats the mixture. That gives me a very smooth, thick mixture which cooked up beautifully., , Frankly, I like these bars but I\u2019d be tempted to rename them because calling them \u2018lemon bars\u2019 sets expectations. They\u2019re more of a \u2018lemon custard bar\u2019 perhaps?, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Support @ Minimalist Baker, , says, , , August 21, 2024 at 9:46 am, , , , Thank you for sharing your experience, Erin!

I made it today and liked it but didn\u2019t love it (yet). I will make it again. I\u2019ll make less crust or will use some of it for another dessert. It was a bit too thick for me but has a good taste. It could be a bar by itself! I wasn\u2019t 100% thrilled with the lemon mixture. There was something missing but I can\u2019t put my finger on what it was. I added more lemon juice and zest. I still needed a bit more of something\u2026 I\u2019ll make it again. Perhaps the lemons weren\u2019t as ripe as needed or a bit bland instead of more sour. It was good but not great. The consistency was very much like cheesecake, which was exciting!

It actually lacked the creaminess and \u201cairiness\u201d that was appealing to me about the recipe and photos, and the flavours weren\u2019t very bright or particularly tasty after baking even though i added more zest (looks like another reviewer experienced this too- i think i saw on the youtube comments). Unfortunately i would not try this recipe again and do not recommend it. Was not worth it especially because i buy nuts organic and this recipe uses a whole 2 cups of 2 nuts and just ended up feeling like a waste. Also, the base for me was very crumbly and didn\u2019t hold together well., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Support @ Minimalist Baker, , says, , , June 10, 2024 at 10:45 am, , , , We\u2019re so sorry you didn\u2019t enjoy it! For the crust, it sounds like it needed more coconut oil or to press more firmly. Tapioca starch and arrowroot starch are different so that may have been part of the issue with the filling. If you\u2019re looking for a more classic, bright lemon bar, we\u2019d suggest our, other lemon bar recipe, ., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , The Vegan Goddess, , says, , , May 19, 2024 at 8:14 pm, , , , This is a delicious healthy treat!

And for those of you out there feeding people of all different food preferences and allowances, this was an across the board pleaser no matter if the crowd is vegan, gluten free, cane sugar free or not. The lemon flavor is so bright and dominant. I will say that my child wasn\u2019t a big fan because he said it was too tart.

Let rest for 1 hour (uncovered). Then drain thoroughly., In the meantime, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line an, 8\u00d78 inch baking dish, with parchment paper., Add oats, almonds, sea salt, and coconut sugar to a, high-speed blender, and mix on high until a fine meal is achieved., Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and add maple syrup and melted coconut oil, starting with lesser end of range (4 Tbsp or 60 g as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and adding more if it\u2019s too dry. Stir with a spoon to combine until a loose dough is formed. You should be able to squeeze the mixture between two fingers and form a dough instead of it crumbling. If too dry, add a bit more melted coconut oil., Transfer mixture to parchment-lined baking pan and spread evenly. Then place parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to press down firmly until it\u2019s evenly distributed and well packed., Bake for 15 minutes, then increase heat to 375 F (190 C) and bake for 5-8 minutes more, or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool slightly, then reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (176 C)., Once cashews are soaked and drained, add to a high-speed blender with coconut cream, arrowroot starch, lemon juice, lemon zest, sea salt, and maple syrup. Mix on high until very creamy and smooth., Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added a bit more lemon zest and maple syrup. It should be very lemony, and not overly sweet., Pour filling over the pre-baked crust and spread into an even layer. Tap on counter to remove any air bubbles., Bake for 20-23 minutes or until the edges look very slightly dry and the center appears \u201cjiggly\u201d but not liquidy., Let rest for 10 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator to let cool completely (uncovered) \u2013 at least 4 hours, preferably overnight., To serve, slice and sift with powdered sugar (optional). Store leftovers in the refrigerator, covered, up to 4 days, though best within the first 2 days., , Video, , Notes, *If you open your can of coconut milk or cream and the cream is not separated from the liquid, that\u2019s ok!

This will take approximately 15-20 minutes. You want the caramel to reach firm ball stage (if you drop a little caramel into ice-cold water it should form a firm non-sticky ball in your fingers). If the caramel hasn\u2019t reached this stage, cook it for a little longer., , Once ready, carefully pour the caramel over the biscuit base, leveling off with a spoon. Be very quick as this caramel sets quite quickly., , Refrigerate for 3-4 hours or until the caramel is set and firm.\u00a0 for an hour before coating. Make sure the caramel has fully set, if not, it will be very gooey and a nightmare to coat in chocolate., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , Rick Castle, , June 3, 2022 / 10:18 am, , , , I have read this blog often, it is a very impressive and informative blog., the vip gentlemens club, ., , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , Jessica L Roberts, , August 26, 2023 / 7:58 pm, , , , I made them tonight for my family and they couldn\u2019t believe they were vegan!!!!!!!

Let\u2019s chat about the layers in a-little more detail., , Shortbread :, Shortbread is the best form of biscuit. It\u2019s soft, buttery and light and literally melts in your mouth. It\u2019s ridiculously easy to make and bake, and makes for the best base for the caramel., , Caramel :, This is the ULTIMATE vegan caramel, it\u2019ll be like liquid gold if done correctly., , Bake the shortbread until golden:, Be sure to bake it for the perfect time, don\u2019t over bake or the shortbread will be super dry and will crumble when you try and cut the bars. The shortbread slab wants to be lightly golden\u2026that\u2019s the perfect colour for the base., , Chill the caramel and shortbread layer:, Make sure you give the shortbread/caramel bars time to chill and set up. This will make dunking the bars in the melted chocolate so much cleaner and easier., , Sprinkle with salt:, Add a dash of salt over the bars before serving. Sweet caramel and salt is the BEST flavour combo and makes the bars taste like salted caramel \u2026 it\u2019s heavenly, but if you don\u2019t want it on there\u2026 leave it off! It\u2019s completely optional., , , , If you make, and love this recipe, please leave a \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 rating below. Thank you & happy baking!

Make sure the base and sides are fully lined, as the caramel could stick., , In a medium mixing bowl, sift in the flour and sugar. Add in the butter and vanilla extract, using your fingertips, rub the butter into the dry mixture until a dough forms. Form into a ball., , Press the dough into the lined tin, making sure it\u2019s even. Prick the base with a fork., , Pop into the oven and bake for 30 minutes or until lightly golden in colour. Once golden, remove from the oven and place the tin onto a cooling rack., , Leave the shortbread in the tin as we\u2019ll be pouring over the caramel., , , , , , , Fill a small saucepan 3/4 full with water, creating a bain-marie, place onto the hob over low/ medium heat., , Finely chop the dark chocolate and place into a heat proof bowl. Place the bowl on top of the saucepan and allow to melt., , Cut the bars into thin, finger-width sizes. Tip: To get an even amount of bars, slice the entire sheet in half (width-wise), then cut about 6 bars from each half, for a total of approximately 12, thin bars. Use a large, sharp knife to prevent the biscuit base from crumbling apart., , One by one, balance the Twix Bars on a fork or spatula, and using a spoon, pour the chocolate over the bars, allowing any excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Don\u2019t try to dunk the bars as that risks the shortbread base from crumbling. Repeat for all bars. Place them onto grease proof paper and pop into the freezer for 10 minutes or fridge for 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set., , Drizzle any left over chocolate for decoration., , Serve with a sprinkling of sea salt (optional)., , , , , , Notes, , , To store: Store the bars in a sealed container, allow the come to room temperature before enjoying.

Hope that helps!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Erin Contour, , says, , , August 20, 2024 at 8:32 pm, , , , I made this using substitutions since I didn\u2019t have what I thought I did. I substituted Organic Rolled Oats with Ancient Grains & Seeds instead of the oatmeal and Blanched Almond Flour instead of almonds (3/4 c flour rather than 1 c almonds, had to guess about that). Figured they were going to get ground up anyway so the flour should work. These two substitutions resulted in a crust that was drier than I would have liked (the cereal mix had chia seeds which could definitely have sucked up moisture) but they worked in that I achieved a crust that was tolerably crumbly and held together. I am OK with the flavor but sure the straight oatmeal would be better and ditto with the almonds. The flour is a less flavorful., , When I blended the lemon mixture I did double the zest trying to increase the lemon flavor. It\u2019s there, , I did do something with my blender that I often do making vegan sour cream etc. and that is to blend on soup mode which both blends and heats the mixture. That gives me a very smooth, thick mixture which cooked up beautifully., , Frankly, I like these bars but I\u2019d be tempted to rename them because calling them \u2018lemon bars\u2019 sets expectations. They\u2019re more of a \u2018lemon custard bar\u2019 perhaps?, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Support @ Minimalist Baker, , says, , , August 21, 2024 at 9:46 am, , , , Thank you for sharing your experience, Erin!

I made it today and liked it but didn\u2019t love it (yet). I will make it again. I\u2019ll make less crust or will use some of it for another dessert. It was a bit too thick for me but has a good taste. It could be a bar by itself! I wasn\u2019t 100% thrilled with the lemon mixture. There was something missing but I can\u2019t put my finger on what it was. I added more lemon juice and zest. I still needed a bit more of something\u2026 I\u2019ll make it again. Perhaps the lemons weren\u2019t as ripe as needed or a bit bland instead of more sour. It was good but not great. The consistency was very much like cheesecake, which was exciting! I\u2019m glad I made it. I also loved that it was easy.

It actually lacked the creaminess and \u201cairiness\u201d that was appealing to me about the recipe and photos, and the flavours weren\u2019t very bright or particularly tasty after baking even though i added more zest (looks like another reviewer experienced this too- i think i saw on the youtube comments). Unfortunately i would not try this recipe again and do not recommend it. Was not worth it especially because i buy nuts organic and this recipe uses a whole 2 cups of 2 nuts and just ended up feeling like a waste. Also, the base for me was very crumbly and didn\u2019t hold together well., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Support @ Minimalist Baker, , says, , , June 10, 2024 at 10:45 am, , , , We\u2019re so sorry you didn\u2019t enjoy it! For the crust, it sounds like it needed more coconut oil or to press more firmly. Tapioca starch and arrowroot starch are different so that may have been part of the issue with the filling. If you\u2019re looking for a more classic, bright lemon bar, we\u2019d suggest our, other lemon bar recipe, ., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , The Vegan Goddess, , says, , , May 19, 2024 at 8:14 pm, , , , This is a delicious healthy treat!

And for those of you out there feeding people of all different food preferences and allowances, this was an across the board pleaser no matter if the crowd is vegan, gluten free, cane sugar free or not. The lemon flavor is so bright and dominant. I will say that my child wasn\u2019t a big fan because he said it was too tart. I prefer a dessert that is slightly sweet but not cloying, however for kids, the maple could be upped., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Support @ Minimalist Baker, , says, , , April 2, 2024 at 11:08 am, , , , Thanks so much for sharing!

Let rest for 1 hour (uncovered). Then drain thoroughly., In the meantime, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line an, 8\u00d78 inch baking dish, with parchment paper., Add oats, almonds, sea salt, and coconut sugar to a, high-speed blender, and mix on high until a fine meal is achieved., Transfer to a medium mixing bowl and add maple syrup and melted coconut oil, starting with lesser end of range (4 Tbsp or 60 g as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and adding more if it\u2019s too dry. Stir with a spoon to combine until a loose dough is formed. You should be able to squeeze the mixture between two fingers and form a dough instead of it crumbling. If too dry, add a bit more melted coconut oil., Transfer mixture to parchment-lined baking pan and spread evenly. Then place parchment paper on top and use a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to press down firmly until it\u2019s evenly distributed and well packed., Bake for 15 minutes, then increase heat to 375 F (190 C) and bake for 5-8 minutes more, or until the edges are golden brown and there is some browning on the surface. Remove from oven to cool slightly, then reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (176 C)., Once cashews are soaked and drained, add to a high-speed blender with coconut cream, arrowroot starch, lemon juice, lemon zest, sea salt, and maple syrup. Mix on high until very creamy and smooth., Taste and adjust flavor as needed. I added a bit more lemon zest and maple syrup. It should be very lemony, and not overly sweet., Pour filling over the pre-baked crust and spread into an even layer. Tap on counter to remove any air bubbles., Bake for 20-23 minutes or until the edges look very slightly dry and the center appears \u201cjiggly\u201d but not liquidy., Let rest for 10 minutes, then transfer to refrigerator to let cool completely (uncovered) \u2013 at least 4 hours, preferably overnight., To serve, slice and sift with powdered sugar (optional). Store leftovers in the refrigerator, covered, up to 4 days, though best within the first 2 days., , Video, , Notes, *If you open your can of coconut milk or cream and the cream is not separated from the liquid, that\u2019s ok! Just try and tip out as much of the rich, firm white part and leave the liquid behind. It\u2019s not crucial that it\u2019s entirely cream.

        "Kit Kat Bars": "Ingredients: , , There are SO many reasons to love these homemade Kit Kats and here are a few recipe highlights worth mentioning..., , Recipe Highlights, , , vegan:, these Kit Kats are vegan friendly, meaning dairy free and egg free and made without any animal products., , paleo:, although my recipe calls for peanut butter, you can makes these homemade kit kat bars without peanut butter by substituting with, sunbutter, .  In addition, this recipe is grain free, dairy free and refined sugar free - perfect for a paleo dessert., , dairy free:, made without butter and uses dark chocolate, no milk chocolate, , easy to make:, although this recipe does require some assembly, it is easy to make.  Simply make the cookie dough, roll, cut and bake the cookies.  Then sandwich them between fudge and coat in dark chocolate., , , The end result is a healthy Kit Kat recipe with the perfect crunch and a mouthwatering flavor., , This recipe can even be made allergy friendly (gluten free, nut free, egg free, dairy free, soy free) by swapping the almond flour for tigernut flour and the peanut butter for sunbutter., , , , Here's a list of what you'll need to make these gluten free Kit Kat candy bars:, , For the Cookies, , , blanched almond flour, (or, tigernut flour, for nut free), , coconut sugar, , ground flax, , salt, , melted coconut oil, , water, , vanilla extract, , , For the Filling, , , creamy peanut butter (or, sunbutter, ), , dark chocolate, , , For the Coating, , , dark chocolate, , coconut oil, , , If you need these to be nut free Kit Kats, then substitute the almond flour for tigernut flour and swap the peanut butter for sunbutter.  These are simple swaps that don't change much of the taste, texture or flavor., , Another thing to note, you can use any cut-out cookie recipe in place of the one I used.  You just need to make sure the cookie dough can be rolled thin.  Also, a crunchy cookie recipe is best., , For the ground flax, I always make my own by grinding, whole flax seeds, in a, coffee grinder, .  This ensures a fresh, finely ground flax \"flour\"., , , How to Make Healthy Kit Kats, , Like I mentioned earlier, this healthy Kit Kat bar recipe is easy to make but does require some assembly.  Here's what you need to do:, , First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F., , Make the Cookies, , Next, coconut sugar, ground flax and salt.  This recipe does not contain any baking soda, as you want the cookies to hold their shape - no rise needed., , Then, water and vanilla.  First mix with the dough with a spatula, then use your hands to knead it., , Once the dough is well combined, roll it between two sheets of parchment paper using a rolling pin.  The parchment paper will allow you to roll the dough super thin without it sticking to the surface or the rolling pin.  You want the cookies to be about \u215b\" thick., , Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut the cookies into rectangles about 3.5\" x 0.75\".  Remove the excess dough and set it aside.  (You'll re-roll it to make more cookies.), , Next, transfer the cookie dough on the parchment paper to a baking sheet (keeping the cookies on the parchment).  Bake them at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes.  They will darken in color and should turn out crisp once fully cooled., , After baking the cookies, remove them from the oven and use a knife or pizza cutter to spread the cookies apart.  Let them cool on the pan for 5-10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack., , , Make the Fudge Filling, , After the cookies have cooled, make the fudge filling., , Melt the dark chocolate, then stir in the peanut butter.  I melted my chocolate on the stove top, over low heat.  You may also use the microwave., , Cool the fudge mixture for about 10 minutes before spreading it onto the cookies (It should be thick like frosting)., , Assemble Cookies, , Each Kit Kat has 3 cookies.  Two cookies will be topped with the fudge filling.  So: cookie, fudge, cookie, fudge, cookie., , Once assembled, place the cookies on a baking sheet or large plate and pop in the freezer for 15 minutes.  This allows the fudge filling to harden and will make dipping the Kit Kats in dark chocolate much easier., , Coat in Dark Chocolate, , Lastly, make the dark chocolate coating.  Place the dark chocolate and coconut oil in a small saucepan and melt over low heat, stirring frequently.  (Another option is to melt them in the microwave.), , Once melted, grab the cookies from the freezer and dip them into the melted chocolate., , Here's how I do it: drop a cookie into the chocolate.  Use a fork to rotate the cookie until it is fully coated.  Using the fork, lift the cookie out of the chocolate and allow excess chocolate to drip off, back into the pan.  Then, place the dipped cookie onto a parchment-lined baking sheet to set., , Drizzle any remaining chocolate over the dipped bars., , You can pop the Kit Kats in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to fully set., , , Storage, , These paleo Kit Kats are best kept in the fridge or freezer.  Like many of my recipes, I prefer leftovers straight from the freezer.  (They keep nice and crisp this way.), , Store the Kit Kats in a sealed container or baggie.  They'll last up to two weeks in the fridge or up to two months in the freezer., , , Frequently Asked Questions, , , Here's what is in a conventional Kit Kat candy bar:, , \"Milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass, whey powder, lactose, soya lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, natural flavour), wheat flour, sugar, modified palm oil, cocoa, sodium bicarbonate, soya lecithin, yeast, natural flavour.\", , And here's what I use in my Kit Kat recipe:, , Dark chocolate, almond flour, coconut sugar, ground flax, salt, coconut oil, water, vanilla extract, peanut butter., , Why are Kit Kats unhealthy?, , Looking at the conventional Kit Kat ingredient list, it's easy to point out why Kit Kats aren't healthy.  First off, they contain milk chocolate which uses conventional dairy, is loaded in sugar and contains emulsifiers and \"natural flavour\" (which could be derived from all sorts of unhealthy substances)., , Kit Kats also contain non-organic wheat flour, which most likely contains glyphosate and is disruptive to the gut., , Basically, Kit Kats provide no nutritional benefit and are loaded with refined sugar, conventional dairy, emulsifiers and preservatives., , Are Kit Kats gluten free?, , Kit Kats are not gluten free, but my recipe is!, , How do you make this recipe nut free?, , These can be nut free Kit Kats by substituting the almond flour for tigernut flour and swapping the peanut butter for sunbutter., , , More Homemade Candy Bar Recipes, , , Homemade Protein Snickers Bars, , Healthy Twix Bars, , Chocolate Covered Fig Bars, , Mounds Bars, , , Enjoy!, , , , , , , , , Print, , clock, , clock icon, cutlery, , cutlery icon, flag, , flag icon, folder, , folder icon, instagram, , instagram icon, pinterest, , pinterest icon, facebook, , facebook icon, print, , print icon, squares, , squares icon, heart, , heart icon, heart solid, , heart solid icon, , , , , , , Healthy Kit Kat Recipe (Gluten Free, Vegan), , , , , , , , , , , 5 Stars, , , , , , , , , 4 Stars, , , , , , , , , 3 Stars, , , , , , , , , 2 Stars, , , , , , , , , 1 Star, , , , 5, from, 1, review, , , , , , , Author:, , Katie, , , Prep Time:, , 40 minutes, , , Cook Time:, , 8 minutes, , , Total Time:, , 48 minutes, , , Yield:, , 11, -, 12, Kit Kat Bars, 1, x, , , , , , , Print Recipe, , , , , Pin Recipe, , , , , , , , , , Description, , , These homemade Kit Kat bars are a healthy spin on the original version.\u00a0 They're crispy, crunchy and absolutely delicious!\u00a0 Gluten Free, Vegan and Paleo., , , , , , , , , , , , Scale, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , , Cookies, , , 1 \u00bc cup, , blanched almond flour, (or, tigernut flour, ) (, 115g, )*, , 3 Tbsp, , coconut sugar, , 1 Tbsp, ground flax**, , \u215b tsp, salt, , 3 Tbsp, melted coconut oil, , 1 Tbsp, water, , 1 tsp, vanilla extract, , , Fudge Filling, , , 2 Tbsp, dark chocolate, , 3 Tbsp, , peanut butter, (or, Sunbutter, ), , , Chocolate Coating, , , 1 cup, dark chocolate (, 5oz, ), , \u00bd Tbsp, coconut oil, , , , , , , , , , , , Cook Mode, , Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , , , , , , coconut sugar, ground flax and salt., , , , water and vanilla.

I used a blend of tigernut and almond flours, because I didn't have enough tigernut. The final product is a bit \"grainy\" and definitely has coconut taste. The chocolate tastes good, especially if you like peanut butter in your chocolate.

        "Vegan Lemon Bars": "Ingredients: , , Classic lemon bars without any eggs? Yup! Today I\u2019m sharing what I think are the best vegan lemon bars, with the perfect balance of shortbread crust to tart lemon filling. And of course, a generous dusting of powdered sugar on top!, , If you are a lemon dessert fan, you will love these little squares of sunshine. And while you\u2019re at it, you might want to try my, vegan lemon cake, , , lemon loaf, or, 1 bowl lemon cupcakes, ., , , How to make Vegan Lemon Bars:, , , First, make the crust., In a medium bowl, mix together the melted vegan butter, sugar and salt. Add the flour and stir to combine. It will be thick. Press it into the prepared pan (lined with parchment paper) evenly and smoothly. Bake for 16-18 minutes at 350 degrees F until lightly golden on the edges., , , While the crust bakes, make the lemon filling., In a medium saucepan, add the lemon juice, lemon zest if using, sugar, coconut milk and cornstarch (+tiny pinch of turmeric if desired for color). Whisk well to dissolve the cornstarch, and heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens. It should look like the photos below, and can take 5-10 minutes., , Remove from heat, and spread lemon mixture over the crust, evenly, using a spatula if needed. Bake for 15 minutes. Let the bars cool for about 30 minutes at room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator to cool another 1-2 hours, or overnight., , , Can I make these lemon bars gluten free?, , I haven\u2019t personally tried these gluten free, but I think it would work with a quality all purpose gluten free flour mix, such as Bob\u2019s Red Mill 1:1 Baking Flour., , How long will vegan lemon bars keep?, , They will keep for about a week in a covered container in the refrigerator. They also freeze really well! The powdered sugar will melt into the bars though, so add some fresh when you want to eat or serve them., , Can you make these a day ahead?, , Yes, these are the perfect dessert to make a day in advance, as they slice better when they have a lot of time to cool. That being said, they can also be ready in an hour or 2, but they may not be as firm as if you left them overnight., , , I hope you LOVE these easy Vegan Lemon Bars!

It should thicken quite a bit in the pan, then it firms up considerably as it chills. You are using cornstarch that isn\u2019t old or doesn\u2019t work for any reason? Cornstarch when mixed and heated with liquid thickens.

These bars tasted delicious and had just the right amount of tart-ness and lemony-ness. I had a question though, is there a gram measurement for the cornstarch by any chance? I doubled the recipe for these today and it of course doubles to 12 tablespoons, so thinking I could measure this out quicker I looked up how many grams in 1 tbsp of cornstarch with varying results. I then decided to weigh 1 tbsp myself and for 12 tbsp that equated to 150g of cornstarch \u2013 it seemed like quite a bit but figured that would be the amount if I did spoon out and level 12 tbsp so went with it. The bars are certainly set! Almost a little too set\u2026 They\u2019re on the side of gummy/gelatinous. I\u2019m in Australia so I know some metric measurements are a little different to the US \u2013 was this just a case of too much cornstarch or is that how they\u2019re supposed to be? And is there a gram conversion for the cornstarch that I\u2019ve missed somewhere as this would eliminate any errors in the future (and make it so so much easier for us Aussies!). Thanks so much for any advice!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Nora, , says:, , , , September 12, 2024 at 7:44 am, , , , , Hi there, and thanks for being a fan of my recipes! \ud83d\ude42 Okay, I checked that out and you\u2019re right, grams were missing for cornstarch. I\u2019ve updated it now to be correct. 6 tablespoons of cornstarch is 48 grams, so even with doubling the recipe, 150g would be too much.

I\u2019ve never had that happen myself. Did you stir constantly as it heated? It\u2019s possible tiny granules formed if it wasn\u2019t being stirred constantly.
