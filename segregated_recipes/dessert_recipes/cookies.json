        "Matcha Chocolate Chip Cookies": "Ingredients: , sugar, , all-purpose flour, , , vanilla extract, , and a pinch of salt. You can easily substitute, all-purpose flour, with, almond flour, to make gluten-free matcha cookies., , The green color of the cookies is because of the, matcha powder, . Matcha powder is a fine powder made from green tea leaves and hence these cookies are also known as green tea cookies., , , , , , , , , 5 Awesome, , Air Fryer, Recipes, , Free email series, , , , , , , , , , , YES, I WANT IT!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Depending on the brand of the matcha powder, the cookies may be less or more green. It is best to use a high-quality matcha powder of culinary grade for optimum results. Also, to ensure that the cookies hold their color on storing, store them in an air-tight container., , I use unsalted butter and it must be at room temperature so you can keep the butter stick outside the fridge for a few hours. If you do not have unsalted butter, you can substitute it with the salted butter and skip the salt., , Chocolate chips add sweetness and chocolatey flavor to the cookies and you can adjust the quantity as per your preference. I have tried making these cookies with baking chocolate chips and also the ones made with, stevia, . Both of them turn out good and taste great!, , , , How to make matcha chocolate chip cookies?, , , It is really very easy to make matcha chocolate chip cookies at home. Before you start making the cookie dough, ensure that the butter is soft and at room temperature. It can also be softened in the microwave by heating it for about 20-30 seconds., , , , , , In a large bowl, whip the butter with a, hand blender, using the, whisk, attachment or in the, stand mixer, using the wire attachment until the butter is light and fluffy. Add sugar and continue to beat the butter and sugar mixture until the mixture is fluffy., , , , Add matcha powder, salt, , vanilla extract, , all-purpose flour, and chocolate chips and mix well. You can use the flat beater attachment of the, stand mixer, to make the cookie dough or bind it with your hands., , , , , , Once the matcha cookie dough is made, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F with the rack at the middle level. In the meantime, divide the dough into equal parts of about 30 grams each, roll them into a ball and flatten them by pressing slightly and place them on a, parchment paper, -lined in the, baking tray, ., , , Place the tray in the oven and bake the matcha cookies for about 15 minutes until the edges start turning golden brown. Remove the tray from the oven and allow the cookies to cool down before transferring or they can crumble and break., , Cooking matcha cookie recipe in air fryer, , Matcha cookies can easily be cooked in the air fryer, especially if you are planning to cook a small batch or if you are baking something else in your oven., , , Since the air fryer is small and the heat circulates in a smaller area, the cookies need a lower temperature of 330 \u00b0F to bake. While you are making balls from the cookie dough, preheat the air fryer to 330 \u00b0F., , , , , , Make balls of about 30 grams each, flatten them by pressing slightly and place them in the air fryer basket on, parchment paper, . Air fry the cookies for about 8 minutes until the edges start turning golden brown., , , Remove the air fryer basket and allow the cookies to cool down completely before transferring., , , , Storing suggestions, , Matcha cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for about a week. If left open or exposed to air, they can lose some green color and turn brown. So to ensure they retain their color, store them in an air-tight container., , , , , If you enjoyed this recipe, you may also like, , , No egg cookies, , Gluten-free cookies, , Pumpkin cookies, , Chocolate covered strawberries, , Matcha ice cream, , Pumpkin mousse, , , , , Don't forget to rate the recipe by clicking the stars.

However, the cookies don\u2019t come out dry at all, so don\u2019t worry about that. The only thing to worry about is whether you can roll the dough into balls. If the dough is just way too crumbly and won\u2019t roll into balls, then add in another tablespoon of soy milk (or other non-dairy milk) and try again., , If the cookies don\u2019t flatten., These cookies usually spread on their own, but if they don\u2019t, you can allow an extra couple of minutes baking time. If they still don\u2019t spread/flatten then just press down on the tops gently with a fork to flatten them while they are still warm and soft from the oven.

Aim to get 20 cookies from the batch., Bake for 10 minutes. The edges will be firm but the cookies will still be soft in the middle. This is fine, they will firm up as they cool., Press in a few more chocolate chips to the top of the cookies as they come out of the oven., , Video, , Notes, , Chocolate chips or chunks., You can use vegan chocolate chunks (chopped up vegan chocolate) instead of chocolate chips. We used chocolate chips in these photos and chocolate chunks in the recipe video., , You may need more soy milk., Depending on the brand of vegan butter you use, you may need 1 or 2 more tablespoons of soy (or other non-dairy) milk. But be patient with each addition of soy milk, stir well and see if you really need more. It is supposed to be a very thick, crumbly cookie dough. But if you try and roll a section into a ball and it just won\u2019t hold together, then you\u2019ll need a little more., , If the cookies don\u2019t spread:, If you peep into your oven at the 10-minute mark and see that your cookies haven\u2019t spread very much, you can bake for a couple of minutes longer. But even if they are quite puffy on the top, this is still fine, and you can just press down on them gently with a fork as soon as they come out of the oven still warm and soft., , Gluten-free:, These cookies work perfectly as gluten-free.

I make them with a teaspoon size cookie scoop, which doubles the number of cookies. I bake half and then freeze the other half, pre-scooped. Baking time is about the same for the frozen cookies \u2013 maybe add a minute or two. I\u2019ve also made the recipe with the additions of cinnamon and Aleppo pepper, using 1/2 cup of chocolate chips with 1/2 cup of dried cherries. Totally works! Next time I might try ginger bits with the chocolate chips., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Nadine @ Loving It Vegan, , says, , , March 20, 2025 at 11:27 am, , , , Happy to hear you enjoyed the recipe Lauren!

This recipe did not disappoint! As noted, the dough is extremely crumbly and it did take a bit of effort to form them into balls for baking. I ended up adding 1T of soy milk at a time for a total of 3T additional on top what the recipe called for. I balled, chilled for about 15 min and baked as written. The cookies turned out PERFECTLY! They were chewy, fudgy and wasn\u2019t crumbly like some vegan cookie recipes tend to do. Oh, I also added 1 tsp of instant coffee mixed in with the soy milk to help boost the chocolate flavor. Thank you for this recipe! The cookies were a hit and no one suspected they were vegan!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Nadine @ Loving It Vegan, , says, , , February 26, 2025 at 7:49 am, , , , That\u2019s amazing Joyce!

If you use a dark chocolate (50%) or over you can use only 100g and it doesn\u2019t really affect the flavor! Also using a slightly flavored dark chocolate is absolutely lush with this recipe it turns out so lovely., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Nadine @ Loving It Vegan, , says, , , February 26, 2025 at 7:51 am, , , , Awesome!

        "Flourless mudslide chocolate cookies": "Ingredients: , , , Powdered sugar \u2013 This acts as a flour in this recipe!

Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray top of parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray (otherwise these cookies really stick!), To the bowl of your mixer, add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Mix together on low speed until mixed together well. (If you have a whisk attachment for your mixer, use that.), Add the egg whites and pure vanilla extract and mix on low until mixed. Batter will be very thick when done!, Remove bowl from mixer. Using a spatula, stir in the mini semi-sweet chips and the dark chocolate chips., Use a medium cookie scoop (#40) to scoop out wet dough mounds onto your sprayed parchment sheets, leaving plenty of room for them to spread during baking. On my large cookie sheet, I did 12, and then 6 on the other cookie sheet. You could do 8 per batch too if your sheet is smaller., I prefer to bake one sheet at a time for even baking. If you need to use the same cookie sheet twice, be sure to let it cool between batches., Bake in 350\u00b0 oven for 12 minutes, or until glossy and cracked and edges are set. They will firm up as they cool too., Remove from oven and let sit on the pan for 2-3 minutes. Slide parchment paper onto cooling rack for cookies to continue to cool.

These taste delicious and the kids enjoy decorating them. -, Jennifer, \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50, , , I just LOVE these cookies. Unlike many sugar cookie recipes that look great but taste bland, these vegan sugar cookies are full of flavor and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The key is to balance the flour, vegan butter, and sugar just right in combination with both vanilla and almond extract. The result? A light, soft, sweet cookie that\u2019s so delicious you\u2019ll be reaching for seconds (or thirds!). With a 5-star rating from over 100 reviews, these cookies are tried, tested, and loved., , Why You'll Love This Recipe, , , Perfect for Cut-Outs:, The dough holds its shape beautifully, making it ideal for detailed cookie cutters., , Tastes Amazing:, Soft, buttery, and full of flavor, they\u2019re as good as they look., , Easy to Make:, , Customizable:, Perfect for any holiday or occasion\u2014Christmas, Valentine\u2019s day, birthday parties, Halloween, or just because! Use your favorite cookie cutter shape and decorate however you like., , , , , , Common Questions, , Can I Prepare the Cookie Dough Ahead of Time?, Yes! You can prepare the dough up to 3 days in advance. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator until ready to use. Let it soften slightly at room temperature before rolling it out., , Can I Freeze These Cookies?, Yes! These cookies freeze beautifully. You can freeze them plain or fully iced. Let them cool completely, then freeze in a single layer on a baking sheet or store them in an airtight container. They\u2019ll keep for up to 3 months., , Can These Be Made Gluten-Free?, Absolutely! Replace the all-purpose flour with a, gluten-free flour 1-to-1 baking blend, . Make sure to chill the dough well to help it hold its shape when rolling and cutting., , What Vegan Butter Should I Ues?, I like to use Earth Balance Original Buttery Spread (the kind in a tub) as it\u2019s reliable for baking. Other brands will also work well\u2014just ensure that the butter is firm when cold (not super soft like margarine) for the best result., , What Vegan Food Coloring Should I Use?, this one, or, this one, ., , Can I Omit the Almond Extract?, Yes! If you prefer not to use almond extract, simply replace it with an equal amount of vanilla extract. The cookies will still be delicious but with a slightly different flavor profile. Alternatively, you can experiment with other extracts like lemon, orange, or peppermint for a unique twist!, , Can I Make a Roll of Cookie Dough and Slice It?, Yes, this dough works well for slice-and-bake cookies! Form the dough into a log, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm (at least 2 hours). When ready, slice into rounds about \u00bc inch thick and bake as directed., , How Do I Get Perfect-Looking Icing?, Ensure your icing is nice and thick. Adding too much plant-based milk will make the icing runny and fall off the cookie. Use, piping bags, or a zip-top bag with the corner snipped off for precise designs. For extra-white icing, I find using, full-fat coconut milk, as the plant-based milk makes it the brightest white (oat and soy milk tend to have a beige tone to them). Double the icing recipe if you plan to go all out with decorating and make several different colors to play with., , , , How To Make Vegan Sugar Cookies:, , Preheat your oven:, Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C)., , , Prepare the chia or flax egg:, In a small bowl, mix together the ground chia or flax and warm water and set aside to thicken.

If the dough does not come together, add water 1 teaspoon at a time (up to 3 teaspoons total) until it just comes together., , , , , Roll out the dough:, Place the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and use a rolling pin to roll it out to about \u00bc inch (6 mm) thick.
