It\u2019s unclear if they should feel like a conventional muffin when finished, but it takes nearly 10 minutes beyond the listed baking time to get something even close to a clean toothpick., , If the intent is to freeze a goopy baked oatmeal in muffin form, then I suppose I understand the enthusiasm. I think the next time I try this recipe, I would consider eliminating the milk entirely. The batter is sufficiently hydrated by the applesauce, butter, and egg. At 20 minutes, this recipe always comes out of the oven looking nearly unbaked.

Subbed melted coconut oil for the vegan butter and baked off in a 8\u00d78 glass baking dish at 350 F for 25 minutes. Wary of gooey-ness, I cooled them fully and even refrigerated for a few hours before slicing, but they held together well and were delightfully fudgy, if a little thin (might 1.5x or double the recipe next time). I greased my pan with coconut oil and they were a little sticky \u2013 might use a proper baking spray next time, but not the brownies\u2019 fault.

A rich & fudge-like experience that covered my desire for chocolate without having to buy vegan chocolate chips/bars (less expensive & more convenient for me!) With tops that shined & held thin crispiness, these brownies were picturesque & greatly enjoyed by those I shared them with. I also LOVE that it was minimal cleanup & took about an hour, maybe 1.5 hours with my rate of cleanup :-), , Factoring in the tradeoff of how easy/quick it was for the decadent taste\u2014this recipe is a keeper! It was a bit crumbly at the bottom & messy to eat but the flavor pulled through. I didn\u2019t hate the crumbliness because it wasn\u2019t dry tasting. The main downside is that you have to work to enjoy every morsel stuck on the liner! I wish mine crisped up a tad more on the sides too but that wasn\u2019t a deal-breaker., , Didn\u2019t modify much: added 1 tsp of espresso to the flax egg (probs could\u2019ve added more?); used unsweetened cocoa, not dutch-process; used about 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour & the remaining 2/4 cup of spelt flour (what I had on hand)., , My batter consistency was mostly smooth & just thick enough to scoop heaping 2 tbsp into 8 paper-lined muffin tins.

Baked at 180C fan but yeah ovens you know. Came out like densish cupcakes.

Do you have any suggestions for the substitutions I made? Chia/flax usually go hand in hand and although coffee is an acid I don\u2019t think it was enough to throw off the brownies since I do this with all my chocolate recipes.

Alternatively, fit each with a paper liner., Prepare flax eggs by mixing flaxseed meal and water in a small bowl and let rest for 5 minutes., Place butter in a large mixing bowl and melt in the microwave. Then stir in the flax egg, sugar, vanilla, baking powder, salt and cocoa powder. Whisk to combine.

A little crispy on the outside and fudgey on the inside. I added the chocolate chips as a mix-in. Substitutions: didn\u2019t have butter, so I subbed the same amount (1/2 cup) of avocado oil. I also subbed Bob\u2019s Red Mill egg replacer for the flax egg. They turned out great. I\u2019m just now realizing I forgot the baking powder (!!!) but they seemed just fine. My mix was very thick, not pourable. I scooped it to fill the cupcake/muffin well about 3/4 of the way full. It yielded 9 in total. Baked at 350 for 22 mins. I\u2019ll definitely make these again!

It\u2019s hurtful to people when they\u2019re expecting one thing and it\u2019s completely different.

One thing in the recipe that was slightly confusing was the flax eggs.

        "Greek yogurt Chocolate Brownies": "Ingredients: , Unlike applesauce or pumpkin puree, replacing the fat with Greek yogurt did NOT result in a gummy or dense texture. In fact, when I served these yogurt brownies to some friends, they thought they must have come out of a box. See, they are as thick and fudgy as any good brownie out there, , minus all the fat, calories, and carbs, !, , If you are skeptical about adding yogurt to your brownies, don\u2019t fret- You won\u2019t even be able to taste it!, , How do you make Greek yogurt brownies, , , , All purpose flour, \u2013 I used white wholewheat all purpose flour, which gives these brownies an added boost of whole grains and fiber. Regularly AP flour works just as well., , Granulated sweetener of choice, \u2013 Any sugar free substitute can be used. I prefer using monk fruit sweetener or erythritol, as they have the most similar texture and flavor to white sugar., , Cocoa Powder, \u2013 Unsweetened cocoa powder.

Love the vegan option and the fact that these are a bit healthier than regular brownies. I used melted semi-sweet chocolate chips, brown sugar, and the So Delicious vanilla coconut milk yogurt. I also added a splash of vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. Although they did turn out moist I would say mine were a bit cakier than expected\u2014like a cross between a chocolate cake and a brownie. Still very tasty and satisfying!

How do I substitute sugar with jaggery powder for this recipe?, , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Cindy Rainey, , , , , October 7, 2020 at 3:43 PM, , , , , , , I have to tell you that before today I had never heard of jaggery powder/sugar. I reached out to a friend of mine who used to own an Indian restaurant knowing that she would be the expert. Not only did I learn a lot about jaggery (and now want to try some!), but I think I have an answer for you. She tells me that you can just sub one-to-one in baked goods. She also tells me the taste will be slightly different but that if you are used to jaggery then you\u2019ll probably like it better anyway. She described it as sweet but slightly bitter \u2013 but in a good way. Sounds like it has a more complex flavor profile than white granulated sugar. Let me know if you decide to try the recipe and sub in the jaggery powder. I\u2019d love to know!

A few notes -The batter was thick and not pourable so I wasn\u2019t sure it was going to work. I smooshed it into the pan and hoped for the best. They also didn\u2019t rise\u2026could be that my baking powder is old. Not sure. Despite that, they weren\u2019t super dense. I\u2019d put the texture between the softness of a muffin and the denseness of a cookie\u2026maybe closer to a coffee cake. Also added a handful of trail mix (mostly sunflower and pumpkin seeds with some dates and pineapple pieces) and it was really good \u2013 almost like a morning glory muffin!, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Leave a, , , , COMMENT, , , , , , , , , , , , Comment, , , , , , , , More HEALTH HUB, , , , , , , , , , , , , , LIFESTYLE, , , , , , , , , Blog, , , , Vegan Recipes, , , , Smoothie E-book, , , , Rewards Program, , , , Refer A Friend, , , , Protein Quiz, , , , Ambassadors, , , , Reviews, , , , , , SUNWARRIOR, , , , , , , , , About Us, , , , Our Commitment, , , , Store Locator, , , , International Distributors, , , , Wholesale, , , , Become an Affiliate, , , , Subscription Program, , , , In the Media, , , , Text with Us, , , , , , CUSTOMER SERVICE, , , , , , , , , Help Center, , , , FAQ's, , , , Shipping, , , , Returns & Exchanges, , , , Login To Your Account, , , , Contact Us, , , , 2250 N.

        "Vegan Matcha Muffins": "Ingredients:  Instructions: ",
        "Flourless Brownie Bites": "Ingredients: , This recipe is designed for a mini muffin tin, but you can also use a full-sized muffin tin, or even make them into brownies! They\u2019ll be delicious any way you do it. And will totally help you get your brownie fix!, , , so what MAKES A LITTLE BITE A LITTLE BITE?, , If you aren\u2019t familiar with, Little Bites, , let me give you some background. My biggest memory of Little Bites is that as a kid, I was NOT allowed to have them. They are these tiny (and I mean tiny!), moist, chewy muffins that come in small bags of 3 or 4. They have a bunch of different flavors, but I feel like we were all begging for chocolate or blueberry. The did have that classic, almost plasticky Entenmann\u2019s taste (no thank you), but they more than made up for it in their sticky sweetness. They were the BEST, and I\u2019d never demonize them. But what I WILL say is that it is so much more fun to make them on your own! Plus then you can, , Reduce your plastic waste, Choose your chocolate level, , So what\u2019s not to love? You get all the fun of Little Bites, plus a better impact on the environment AND you get to choose how many you eat in one sitting \u2013 which let\u2019s be honest, is the true goal here., , , what makes this little bite recipe different?, , I am OBSESSED with this Little Bite Brownie recipe for three main reasons:, , All you need is a blender! No bowl or mixing required. You can find my favorite blender linked, here, ., It makes 24 tiny, moist, deliciously soft muffins \u2013 that\u2019s about 8 times more than what you get in a Little Bite bag (because you just KNOW we are hungry here), This recipe includes a few of my favorite things: apples, almond butter, and REAL chocolate. It\u2019s like all my favorite food groups combined into a gluten-free, flourless dream brownie., (I know I said three above, but I\u2019m including a fourth) It might be the best brownie I\u2019ve ever made. Seriously., , , what do I need to make this little bite fudge brownie recipe?, , but you really can\u2019t beat how simple they are! For this recipe you will need:, , 1\u00a0medium\u00a0apple\u00a0diced, 1/2\u00a0cup\u00a0almond butter\u00a0the drizzly kind, 1\u00a0large\u00a0egg, 5\u00a0tbsp\u00a0cocoa powder, 6\u00a0tbsp\u00a0maple syrup, 1\u00a0tsp\u00a0vanilla extract, 1/2\u00a0tsp\u00a0baking soda, 1/2\u00a0cup\u00a0semi-sweet chocolate chips\u00a0melted, , Can I make any substitutions?, , The answer is always, hellls yeah! But you might see some different results. Here are a few substitutions that will work:, , Almond butter can be subbed for smooth peanut butter, sunflower butter, or tahini! Really any nut butter will work as long as it\u2019s creamy. Just know that almond butter has the most neutral flavor, so any other butter might stand out a big more in the recipe!, Maple syrup can easily be subbed for honey or agave nectar! Honey is less sweet in my opinion, so I\u2019d opt for agave if you can!, If you\u2019re vegan, you can sub the egg for any Vegan Egg replacement. I love using, Just Egg, or, Vegan Egg, . I\u2019ve found flax and chia egg don\u2019t work as well here, unfortunately., And if you want to sub the chocolate chips for any kind of chocolate? Go for it! It will still be amazing, no matter what chocolate you choose \ud83d\ude42, , how to make these little bite brownies, , Lightly grease a 24-muffin mini-muffin tin. Pour the batter into each tin, filling about 3/4 of the way up., Bake at 350F for 16-18 minutes., , Let them cool for a bit and they you\u2019re done!, , The one big thing to note is that if you drain your apples, you\u2019ll get a denser, better result., Any excess liquid can kind of mess with the baking process, so try to get your apples soft, you shouldn\u2019t have to strain them too much!, , , made these and loved them?

        "Banana Oat Muffins": "Ingredients: , The difference between these 2 is the texture. The first one yields a super light and airy cake whereas the second one makes a slightly denser cake., , Creaming butter and sugar requires some effort so it is best to use a hand or stand mixer. However you can also cream them with a whisk and this takes about 3 to 4 minutes depending on your effort., , , Bananas, : Use only ripe bananas. I use the large yellow bananas. You can use pureed or mashed bananas. With mashed bananas you will have those specks of banana fibers seen your cake (as visible in my pictures)., , Flour, : This recipe works with all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, white wheat flour, pastry flour and even with atta (chapati flour). But if you prefer to make a light bakery style cake, then do avoid flour to which extra bran has been added. Though this kind of flour works it makes the cake slightly dense., , You can also use a combination of whole wheat flour and all-purpose flour., , Butter, : Use unsalted butter for this banana cake recipe. I feel the flavor of & the freshness of salted butter is not the same as unsalted. However if you still want to use it, then skip the salt mentioned in the recipe., , Baking powder, : This recipe uses baking powder. It cannot be substituted with baking soda. Please recheck the expiry date of baking powder before using. Also use baking powder that has no aluminum content., , Spice, : I usually add \u00be teaspoon ground cinnamon to the batter as we love the warm & sweet flavors of cinnamon. The combo of ripe bananas and cinnamon goes really well. Use it only if you like the flavor., , Sugar, : Some readers mentioned the cake being too sweet for their taste. However it depends on the bananas and the personal preferences. If you prefer your banana cake less sweeter then simply reduce the sugar by \u00bc cup., , More, Cake recipes, Eggless banana bread, Easy banana muffins, Eggless chocolate cake, Eggfree carrot cake, Eggless orange cake, , , , , Photo Guide, , yet soft and should hold its structure. Here are the quantities:, , 2 cups all-purpose flour, or whole wheat flour. Fluff up the flour with a fork in the pack. Spoon it to the measuring cup and level it with a straight edged spoon or knife., 100 grams unsalted butter, 2 eggs, \u00bd cup milk + 2 .5 tablespoons (160 ML), 1 cup mashed bananas (use only ripe bananas), , 2. Preheat the oven to 170 C or 340 F for at least 15 minutes. If you have a fan forced oven, then preheat to 160 C or 320 F., , 3. Grease a 8 by 8 inch square cake pan and line with a parchment paper. If you do not have a parchment paper then simply dust some flour all over the cake pan including the sides. Shake well and invert it and dust off the excess in your kitchen sink., , 4. Before you begin to make the batter, ensure the butter is soft but still cold. To check press the block of cold butter with your finger, it should dent slightly yet hold its solid structure and should not be too soft. \u00a0More importantly it has to be still cold. This is the kind of butter we want here. Add 1 cup sugar and 100 grams butter to a mixing bowl. You can also use your stand mixer., , , , Make Batter, , 5. Beat them together until light, pale and fluffy. When it is done, the whole mixture will look light in color. Sugar will not be dissolved at this stage. If you live in a hot place and feel your butter is about to melt then simply keep the bowl in the fridge for a while. Then continue to beat. It is important for the butter not to melt at this stage., , , , 6. Now add 2 teaspoons vanilla and 1 egg. Mix gently until combined and then beat until well incorporated & creamy., , , , 7. Then add the other egg and beat just until creamy., , , , 8. This is the texture we want and do not over beat at this stage., , , , 9. Place a sieve over the mixing bowl. Add 2 cups wheat flour or all-purpose flour, \u00bd teaspoon salt & 2\u00bd teaspoons baking powder. Gently mix them well first with a spoon. Then sieve them to the creamed butter and egg mixture., , , , 10. Mix it gently with the whisk. Then pour \u00bc cup milk and mix gently. Next add another \u00bc cup milk., , , , 11. Mix just until well combined on a medium speed. You will need another 2.5 tablespoons milk while mixing. Add that as well. Avoid over mixing. Scrape the sides and bottom. Check if everything is well combined., , , , 12. Then add 1 cup mashed bananas., , , , 13. Mix again until well combined. Avoid over mixing., , , , Bake Banana Cake, , 14. Pour this to the lined caked tray. Tap the tray to the counter a few times to release air bubbles., , , , 15. Bake for 25 to 30 mins if using a 8 by 8 square pan. Adjust the timing slightly if needed. If using a different size pan, then the timings vary. A skewer/ tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean when the cake is done. If you see moist crumbs on the tester, you may bake for a little longer., , , , 16. Place the cake pan on a wired rack and cool for 10 mins so the cake doesn\u2019t sweat at the bottom. Then invert the pan gently to remove the cake., , , , Cool completely before slicing., , , , , Photo Guide, , , , , 3. To a mixing bowl, add mashed bananas, beaten egg, melted butter, milk, 6 to 8 tablespoons ( \u00bd cup) sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix all of them., , , , 4. Then add flour in 2 batches mixing just until combined., , , , 5. You should have a uniform batter with no streaks of flour in it. Use a spatula to clean out the sides of the bowl while you mix. Do not over mix as the cake can end up being gluey., , , , 6. Transfer this to the prepared pan. Tap the pan to the kitchen counter., , , , 7. Bake at 170 C for 30 mins if using a 6 inch pan, if using a loaf pan (8x4x2.5 inches) then bake for about 35 to 36 minutes. When done, a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. If the skewer comes out with batter or wet mixture, bake it a little longer until it comes out clean. You need to adjust the baking temperature depending on the bakeware and oven., , , , Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes and then remove it to a wired rack. Cool completely before slicing. Avoid slicing hot banana cake., , , , Pro Tips & Notes, , Creaming butter and sugar, : This most important step is to beat the butter and sugar right to a creamy consistency as this helps in making the cake light. To beat it right, the temperature and texture of the butter is important. It has to be cold, yet soft and hold shape. They are creamed together to incorporate air., , If your butter is not cold then it will begin to melt & the air bubbles will collapse. If it is too cold and firm, then you won\u2019t be able to incorporate air into it., , Avoid overmixing, and just mix until well combined at every step. Overmixing will lead to flat cakes. The cake may rise and then sink., , Measure flour correctly, by following the 3 steps \u2013 fluff up the flour, spoon it to the cup and lastly level it. This gives accurate results., , Pan size, : Most time I make this cake in a 8 inch square pan. On occasions when I did not have enough bananas, , Faqs, , What is the difference between a banana cake and a banana bread?, , , , How to substitute eggs in banana cake?, , Use \u00bc cup buttermilk or homemade yogurt for every egg in the recipe. Avoid using Greek yogurt as it is too thick to use as a substitute., , , Why does banana cake sink?, , Using too much of leavening agents can cause the cake to sink. The cake rises a lot due to the excess leavening and then it collapses so it sinks., , , Can I use whole wheat flour to make banana cake?, , Yes.

I doubled the recipe & used 2 1/4 cup white flour & 1 cup whole wheat flour. I subbed the canola oil with olive oil. I was a bit concerned I was doing something wrong when trying to mix the oil with yogurt but all worked out. I probably used a bit more yogurt than called for & added a splash of milk.

Warning that the consistency of the raspberry muffin batter will be entirely dependent on how much liquid is in the yogurt you choose to use. I personally used a blend of plain Greek and strawberry Greek yogurt. This recipe works with any berries, as I used mixed berries instead and it was still fantastic. The batter was a little dry, so I added almond milk until it was properly viscous.

The recipe turned out more like a stiff dough than a batter, so I added an extra egg, 1/3 C of greek yogurt, and 1/4 C of 2% milk. I didn\u00b4t have raspberry yogurt so I mixed in 20 g of raspberry jam into the yogurt., , , , , , , , , , Debbie, September 3, 2020 at 11:47 am, , , , My tweaks were olive oil in place of canola, as that is what I had on hand. I found the dough to be dry and crumbled like some cookie doughs. I added milk gradually to make a batter. I used frozen mixed berries, straight from the freezer, and baked as directed. They came out great! The taste is something I need to get use to since they aren\u2019t sweet.

Although I did have to use a little more yogurt and a bit of milk to make the consistency of the batter a little more pourable\u2026. but overall a yummy treat!, , , , , , , , , , Jen F, June 29, 2020 at 3:39 pm, , , , I make these all the time, many different varieties, today\u2019s I did lemon yogurt and blueberries., , , , , , , , , , lisa, June 5, 2020 at 1:52 am, , , , I baked mine at 350, but always do, regardless since high altitude dries everything out\u2026.Low and slow is best for my baking., I made mine using nonfat greek yogurt, blueberries, orange zest and orange juice. Someone ate the raspberries right before I made these. I did make homemade buttermilk to add more liquid to the recipe since the batter was more like a chunky bread dough. Plus the tanginess of the yogurt could be tempered with the addition of an oil (in my case, orange) or a flavored yogurt (again, orange) as the writer suggested., , , , , , , , , , Lynn, May 25, 2020 at 6:06 pm, , , , This is a great tasting muffin recipe and such a good idea to use yogurt! I added about 1/4 cup milk and cooked at 375F for about 15 minutes after I saw some of the comments. It turned out perfect! I liked how they do not taste as sweet as other muffins., , , , , , , , , , Anna, October 6, 2019 at 10:24 am, , , , Amazing recipe. I read the comments and tweaked the baking temperature to 370F. I also found the batter was a little bit thick so I did as others mentioned and added more yogurt. Used frozen raspberries because I find that they don\u2019t mush into the batter as much and stay whole. Sooooo delicious.  Already in my recipe book collection., , , , , , , , , , Connie Skelton, August 15, 2019 at 8:28 pm, , , , Just made these today.  Other than baking for 15 min instead of 20 min, to account for carry-over cooking, I followed the recipe exact and they came out delish.  My husband and kids loved them.

But let them thaw and drain., , , , , , , , , , , , B Summers, June 12, 2018 at 3:20 pm, , , , These were so easy and delicious!  I have an abundance of raspberries from the garden this year and this recipe is just perfect!  I used low carb raspberry yogurt and had to add about 2 oz. more plus a little warm water to thin out the dough as it was a little thick.  I lowered the temp to about 360 and cooked for about 22 minutes.  My oven runs a little hot and I was worried about burning them as per other reviews.  I ate one hot out of the oven with a little honey butter\u2026. HEAVEN!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make this again soon., , , , , , , , , , Kim Schwartz, March 1, 2018 at 11:17 pm, , , , The batter was extremely dry so I added about 1/3 cup half and half.  I also baked them at 375 for about 20-25 min. and the toothpick was clean but wet.

I made them with gluten free flour and plain coconut yogurt and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. They made 12, but I\u2019m already on my 3rd!, Thank you!, , , , , , , , , , Cecilia Selders, October 23, 2017 at 4:02 pm, , , , I just made these and found there was not enough liquid to absorb all the flour, so I added about 1/2 cup of buttermilk to loosen up the dough. I also think they could use just a bit more sugar, not a lot. The muffins stuck to the paper liners, so next time I would I\u2019ll spray the liners. I think this recipe could be great with a few little tweaks. I really like the idea of useing flavored yogurt with same fresh fruit, peach with peach etc., , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, October 24, 2017 at 8:25 am, , , , Thanks for all the tips, Cecilia!, , , , , , , , , , , , Tara Carrafa, August 16, 2017 at 6:36 am, , , , I also found the batter to be very thick so I added a bit more yoghurt and that helped. The batter tasted and looked good however when they were cooked they turned quite green! They actually looked mouldy but tasted nice. I can\u2019t understand why as the frozen raspberries had no visible green and I didn\u2019t use blueberries. I used plain Greek yoghurt lactose free., Any ideas why this might happen?, , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, August 16, 2017 at 10:10 am, , , , How weird! My guess is there was something in the yogurt that gave a little yellow and the berries gave a little blue, thus it turned your muffins green., , , , , , , , , , , , Chris, July 28, 2017 at 9:36 pm, , , , I made these with organic flour and sugar and Greek yogurt. The batter was very thick. I just added some raspberry juice from the bottom of the the bowl that I had put my washed berries in the night before which made the consistency perfect. As were the muffins., , , , , , , , , , Carrie, July 21, 2017 at 6:54 pm, , , , I just found this recipe yesterday, and I love the muffins.  I made them just as the recipe stated, except baked them at 350 degrees. I don\u2019t know why people said that the batter was too thick\u2026 I made it without adding any extra liquid and it was fine. Perhaps people forget that muffins are more of a sweet bread than a cake, so it\u2019s more of a dough than a thin batter\u2026 will be making these again, but maybe try different yogurts to change it up once in a while. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!, , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, July 22, 2017 at 1:18 pm, , , , Thanks for letting me know Carrie. Glad you enjoyed the recipe!, , , , , , , , , , , , TayPye93, June 19, 2017 at 3:30 am, , , , The batter was too thick to start off with. It looked more like cookie batter than muffin batter. We added half a cup of milk to the mixture which helped with the consistency., We used a cup of mixed frozen berries instead with good results!, We changed the heat because 204 degrees Celsius (400 Degrees Fahrenheit)  with a fan-forced oven was too hot. We used 180 Degrees (356 Fahrenheit)., We sprinkled a little sugar on top and the result was a lovely crunch., The batter didn\u2019t make 12 even after we added milk!, All in all it was a nice tasty muffin and I think next time we might add some white chocolate!, , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, June 19, 2017 at 5:32 pm, , , , Thanks for all the feedback.

Any ideas?, , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, May 31, 2017 at 4:26 pm, , , , You could try running it through an online nutritional calculator since David didn\u2019t supply that info., , , , , , , , , , , , Mandy, January 28, 2017 at 10:43 am, , , , So I made these this a.m and they were super thick while mixing them. I added a half cup of water to it and they were great. I andlso did look up the recipe on the boxed muffins and they andlsoctually had less carbs in them plus only 20 grams of carbs more. I don\u2019t think it was worth the extra calories unless you enjoy experimenting (which I do but I\u2019m really trying to watch my caleries) my children loved them but I may try blueberry or cherry next time when I\u2019m not as concerned about carbs. Very good though., , , , , , , , , , Cristina, December 20, 2016 at 9:24 pm, , , , Instead if coconut milk could you use almond milk or cashew milk?, , , , , , , , , , Lilly, November 21, 2016 at 3:40 am, , , , I\u2019ve used this recipe twice now (once with raspberries, once with mango) and both times the batter was extremely thick \u2013 I had to add a cup of milk each time. I then added more fruit, because it didn\u2019t seem like there was enough.   Lastly, I thought 400 degrees sounded strange for muffins, so I put them in at 370 \u2013 \u2013 they turned out beautifully. Never though of using yoghurt in muffins before \u2013 will do this again!  Really yummy., , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, November 22, 2016 at 10:30 am, , , , Thanks for all your tips, Lilly.

I\u2019m just concerned that lowering the oil may mean dried out muffins., , , , , , , , , , Lauren, February 14, 2017 at 6:02 pm, , , , I would use coconut oil ?, , , , , , , , , , , , Denise, October 1, 2016 at 12:21 am, , , , I agree that 400 is too hot and 40 minutes is too long.I made these for a meeting tomorrow morning and the bottoms look burnt inside the liner afterbaking them for 30 minutes. Very disappointed. I even had left over batter so made some mini ones for my kids that were beyond edible they were so burnt.  Most other muffin recipes I\u2019ve looked at are at a lower temp and less cooking time. Guess I\u2019ll see if i even take the myffins to my meeting or if I stop at the local bakery in the morning to buy muffins., , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, November 2, 2016 at 6:02 pm, , , , Sorry you ended up with burnt muffins, but baking time was 20 minutes and not 40. Others have tried it at 325 degrees for 20 minutes and it\u2019s worked out great. I think it depends on your oven. When making mini muffins you have to decrease the baking time since less batter is cooking., , , , , , , , , , , , Laura, , September 11, 2016 at 6:38 am, , , , I made these yesterday, having had the recipe bookmarked for a while., They\u2019re so good! I love that they\u2019re not super sweet, so the berries really stand out., , It\u2019s definitely the thickest muffin mix I\u2019ve made, and I was a bit concerned that I should\u2019ve added some extra liquid, but they baked wonderfully., I could only get strawberry yogurt, so I used a mix of strawberries and raspberries, which I froze first to stop them getting mushy, and coated in flour to stop them all sinking to the bottom. Considering half the batch have already been eaten, I\u2019ll be making them again! Thank you for sharing the recipe!, , , , , , , , , , Lisly, August 1, 2016 at 10:34 pm, , , , Hi! I made the muffins but they came out kinda mushy(I used organic flour). Do you think that\u2019s why? Or is that how they are suppose to be ?, The taste is great but I\u2019m not sure about the texture. I didn\u2019t mix too much so I\u2019m genuinely confused. Thanks., , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, August 4, 2016 at 1:32 pm, , , , All I can think is that you didn\u2019t measure everything accurately. Either you had too much yogurt or not enough flour. Or maybe you didn\u2019t bake the muffins long enough?, , , , , , , , , , , , Megan, July 18, 2016 at 11:20 pm, , , , I baked them for 18-20 minutes at 325 degrees after reading the previous comment and they were PERFECT! So yummy!, , , , , , , , , , Kiki, July 18, 2016 at 7:17 pm, , ,  Instructions: , Preheat oven to 400 degrees F., Spray, grease, or put paper liners in 12-cup muffin tin (2 3/4 inch)., In a medium mixing bowl, both step 5 and 6 say to add the raspberries. I (perhaps I should have read the next step first) added the raspberries in the step 5 therefore they got all mashed up. My muffins are pink with raspberries throughout not the nice white with raspberries here and there., Perhaps you may want to omit the raspberry addition in step 5 so others don\u2019t make the same rookie mistake I just made. \ud83d\ude42 I hope they tast good. Just waiting for them to cool down. Thanks I will try again tomorrow., , , , , , , , , , Michelle, July 14, 2016 at 1:55 pm, , , , 400 degrees is way too high, the bottom of the muffins are burnt and I only had them in 15 minutes.  The raspberry yogurt muffins are great but I wish they turned out better., , , , , , , , , , Anne-Marie Nichols, , Post author, July 18, 2016 at 1:13 pm, , , , Sorry that your muffins got burnt. This is the first complaint about the temperature being too high. When I\u2019ve made this recipe as well as my Easy Gluten Free Strawberry Yogurt Muffins, I\u2019ve cooked the muffins at 400 degrees with no problems.

If you do not have a silicone pan, I recommend using parchment paper muffin liners in a regular muffin tin. Otherwise, the dough may stick to the tin., , Press the dough across the bottom of the pan. Then, press a tablespoon into the dough to create a well for the peanut butter filling., , , , , , Next, spoon the peanut butter filling into the wells. Store the peanut butter brownie cups in the freezer for 5-10 minutes, or until the peanut butter sets., , , , , , After, prepare the chocolate drizzle. Melt the chocolate chips and coconut oil in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirring together, or until the chocolate is melted. Be careful not to burn the chocolate., , Remove the peanut butter brownie cups from the freezer and the muffin pan. Drizzle the melted chocolate on top. Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top (optional). The chocolate should set quickly since the brownie cups are cold. If needed, store them in the freezer for 1 minute to set. Enjoy!, , , Recipe variations, , How to make them keto, : use, stevia-sweetened maple syrup, and, stevia-sweetened chocolate chips, . Alternatively, such as monk fruit or erythritol alternatives., , How to make them paleo, : use almond butter instead of peanut butter, and raw cacao powder instead of cocoa., , How to make them nut free, : follow the ingredient swaps below, , , Peanut free, : replace the peanut butter with another nut butter, such as almond butter., , Nut free, : replace the peanut butter with sunflower seed butter or tahini. For the flour, you can use oat flour instead and achieve similar results., , , Flour alternatives, : you can use oat flour for this dessert instead of almond flour. However, since almond flour contains more moisture, the brownie dough will be drier and less fudgy., , For mini peanut butter brownie cups, : make this a low calorie dessert by using a, mini muffin tin, . The recipe will create approximately 18 mini cups., , How to store them, , Store the cups inside a sealed container. Place in the refrigerator where they will keep for 1 week. They are also freezer-friendly for long term storage. If freezing, I recommend placing a square of parchment paper between each cup to ensure they do not stick together.

I have not tested this recipe with anything else. The brownies are very soft and fudgy so you definitely need something that solidifies when it cools off!

While I wouldn\u2019t exactly call this \u201ccoffee extract,\u201d it\u2019s sort of similar but there\u2019s no alcohol involved and we\u2019re making it ourselves on the stove., , See my, homemade fudgy brownies, , which is the trusted base recipe for all of my brownies., , Just like I\u2019ve done many times (see my, champagne layer cake, or, glazed mimosa muffins, , both with champagne reduction), we\u2019re making a coffee reduction to add to the brownie batter and also to thin out the mocha frosting., , , , And I mean we are, really, concentrating this stuff., , You\u2019re going to start with one cup of coffee (about 8 ounces) and you\u2019re going to boil it down to just 2 Tablespoons., , This won\u2019t take much time, but you\u2019ll have to make sure you keep an eye on it so that you don\u2019t boil it down to nothing and then wind up with coffee flavored crumbly bits and hot air., , This concentrated coffee will take the place of the vanilla extract completely in the brownies, so you\u2019ll be left with a robust coffee favor hidden deep inside the chocolate flavor., , , , The thing that takes these coffee brownies from wow to POW, though, is most certainly the easy mocha frosting., , I\u2019ve used this, chocolate fudge frosting, several times, and it\u2019s a fan favorite among readers! It\u2019s made with unsweetened baking chocolate and butter as the base, which is similar to how we start our chocolate brownies., , We\u2019ll sweeten it with powdered sugar, as any frosting recipe does, and then thin it out with the remaining concentrated coffee and a little milk or cream., , , , If you want the mocha frosting thinner, feel free to use more coffee, or you can go straight to the milk or cream., , You\u2019ll of course have to wait until your brownies are completely cool before topping them with frosting, but it will be totally worth the wait in the end. If you\u2019re antsy, you can totally throw the brownies into the fridge to allow them to cool there!, , Once frosted and cut and ready to eat, you\u2019ll find these brownies are decadent and rich and not overly sweet., , , , The mocha frosting is a wonderful complement to all the gooey coffee brownie business happening under it, and we enjoyed our brownies alongside a scoop of vanilla a few times. That was totally a killer combo., , These might be my favorite brownie recipe of my monthly lineup so far\u2026 And I\u2019m so excited we still have eight to go!!, , If you love brownies and you love coffee, coffee brownies are where it\u2019s at. The perfect balance of chocolate flavor and coffee notes that make a decadent treat., , , , And since there\u2019s coffee, you can totally have one for breakfast.

Grease and prepare the brownie pan and set it aside., Melt chocolate chips in microwave for a minute, stirring after to see if chips have melted. If not, microwave in increments of 30 seconds until completely melted. Alternatively, you can melt in over a small pot of boiling water (Not a lot of water in the pot) and put the chocolate chips it in a heat proof and melt proof bowl over the pot and stir until melted., In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, salt and baking soda until combined. Set aside., In a separate bowl, add the flax eggs or egg replacement, coconut sugar and coconut oil and mix until combined for about 2 minutes. Add the water and the vanilla extract. Add to the dry mixture to the wet mixture and melted chocolate chips and stir for about 3 minutes until combined., Pour into a greased, parchment lined, or a greased foil-lined 8x8 square pan., Warm up the peanut butter for about 15 seconds until warm and extra runny. Dollop the peanut butter on top of the brownies. I like to do it in medium circles that don't touch all over the batter, then slowly using a knife, swirl left to right from top to bottom through the batter, up and down from right to left to get the swirl through the whole batter. Don't over do it or you'll just get a muddle., Bake for 40-45 minutes. The centre might still be a bit wobbly. When finished, remove from oven carefully and allow to cool completely until room temperature.

I notice we are on the same wavelength! ???? Making these easy homemade chocolate oatmeal muffins was seriously a breeze. You don\u2019t even need a blender or food processor to whip up this tasty vegan dessert., , , You can enjoy the muffins for breakfast or grab one in the afternoon when you need some energy. They\u2019re also great for your kid\u2019s lunch box and healthier than store-bought chocolate muffins. Furthermore, free of eggs, cow\u2019s milk, and butter! Let\u2019s do this!, , , , I love creating (and eating!!!) healthy vegan and gluten-free treats and beside brownies muffins are my go-to dessert. They have the perfect size to satisfy any sweet cravings and the best part is that they are so easy to make. You can bake them with your kids, I am sure they would love to get involved., , , , , Oats or oat flour, \u2013 If you have store-bought oat flour at home, you are all set. If you have oats, simply use an electric coffee/spice grinder or a regular blender to make oat flour. Blend for 10 seconds and voil\u00e0, you have oat flour. Make sure to use certified gluten-free oats/oat flour, if you are a celiac., , Coconut sugar, \u2013 You can use brown sugar, white sugar, date sugar or any other granulated sweetener. I only used 1/3 of a cup because the vegan chocolate chips also contain sugar, however, if you have a sweet tooth, feel free to add 1/2 cup sugar., , Cocoa powder, \u2013 I always use unsweetened cocoa powder. Please note that natural cacao powder has a slightly bitter taste. Dutch-processed cocoa powder is probably not the healthiest option but it still works in this recipe., , Dairy-free chocolate chips, \u2013 I use, these vegan mini chocolate chips, but you can use regular-sized chocolate chips., , Plant-based milk, \u2013 Any plant-based milk is fine. Some examples are almond milk, oat milk, cashew milk, coconut milk, etc. The higher the fat content of the milk is, the richer and tastier the chocolate muffins will be., , Applesauce, \u2013 Lately, I have been experimenting more often with applesauce and I love baking with it. Not a fan? Simply, use mashed banana instead., , Nut butter, \u2013 I used peanut butter because that\u2019s what I had on hand. You can also use almond butter, cashew butter or sunflower seed butter for a nut-free version!, , Apple cider vinegar, \u2013 In combination with the baking powder and baking soda, it helps the muffins to rise. You can use white vinegar or lemon juice instead., , !, , , How To Make Vegan Chocolate Muffins?, , STEP 1:, First, you should line a muffin pan with paper liners (or grease the pan). Preheat oven to 360 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)., , STEP 2:, , STEP 3:, , STEP 4:, Divide the batter among the wells of the muffin pan. I had enough batter to make 8 muffins., , STEP 5:, Bake for 24 to 27 minutes or until you spot cracks on top of the muffins. Insert a toothpick into the center of a muffin. It should come out almost clean (it\u2019s ok if the toothpick is crumbly/slightly sticky but it shouldn\u2019t come out wet)., , STEP 6:, Let the vegan double chocolate chip muffins cool and enjoy!, , , How To Store?, , Store leftover muffins in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze in zip-lock bags for up to 3 months., , , These Flourless Chocolate Muffins Are:, , , Vegan (dairy-free, egg-free), , Gluten-free, , Can be made nut-free, , Can be made refined sugar-free, , Moist, , Fudgy, , Delicious, , Easy to make in one bowl, , Healthier than most chocolate muffins, , , , If you love chocolate, make sure to check out my other delicious, vegan & gluten-free desserts, :, , , Vegan Lava Cake, , Chocolate Zucchini Cake, , Vegan Chocolate Pie, , Chocolate Crepes, , Vegan Zucchini Brownies, , Best Vegan Brownies, , Flourless Brownies, , Sweet Potato Brownies, , Healthy No-Bake Brownies, , , Should you give these healthy vegan double chocolate muffins a try, please leave a, comment and rating, below and tag me in your Instagram or Facebook post with #elavegan and, @elavegan, ., , , , , Vegan Chocolate Muffins, , , Author:, Michaela Vais, , , made in one bowl, in about 30 minutes!

        "Vegan Blueberry Muffins": "Ingredients: gluten free, oil free or whole grain., Add a little lemon zest and extract for lemon blueberry muffins, or replace the blueberries with chocolate chips for chocolate chip muffins! The possibilities are endless., , Consider making a batch of, tofu scramble, or my favorite, tempeh bacon, to go along with them for a delicious breakfast or brunch!, , , , , Soy milk, \u2013 Another non-dairy milk will also work, such as almond, coconut, hemp or oat milk., , Apple cider vinegar, \u2013 Just a teaspoon is needed., , Flour, \u2013 Use all purpose flour for light colored, fluffy muffins or a whole grain flour for a sturdier, fiber rich muffin. A gluten free flour mix also works., , Sugar, \u2013 May substitute coconut sugar, or cut the amount needed in half for less sweet muffins., , Baking powder, , Salt, , Cornstarch, \u2013 Arrowroot or tapioca starch would also work., , Oil, \u2013 Canola, melted vegan butter or coconut oil is fine.

They still might be a bit purple in color, but they will taste just as good!, , How to store leftover muffins, , You can store muffins in a covered container for about 3 days.
