However, I hope you can help me since I made this for my brother\u2019s birthday tomm.  I followed the recipe exactly only using almond milk  instead and cooked it for 15-20 min on medium heat then refrigerated it. After several hours it gelled like jello! I didnt even pour it in the tart crust yet! Is this normal? Did I overcook it? Can I use an immersion blender and  add liquid or reheat it? Please help if you can! Thank you!, , , , , , , , , , , Nadia, September 8, 2017 at 6:12 pm, - Reply, , , , Hi Tammy. Hmm you may have overcooked the filling. It starts to harden as soon as the mixture cools and that\u2019s why I suggest pouring it straight into the crusts. I don\u2019t think heating it will help, but you could try. You can try adding less agar agar next time or leave it out completely. Different brands might give different results.

Do you know what could be adjusted?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , Kim Lange, , says:, , , , November 25, 2023 at 11:09 am, , , , , If you add too much milk may be one option, depending on what non-dairy almond milk you\u2019re using, you could use a little less milk. If it\u2019s not thickened up enough when cooking over stove, that could be the cause as well.  Overmixing it at the end can also break the pudding down.

You can use lactose-free milk as a substitute for almond milk, and the pie should still set up correctly. However, I\u2019d like to point out that using lactose-free milk would make the recipe non-vegan. If you\u2019re trying to accommodate a relative with a nut allergy but still want to keep it vegan, you could consider using oat milk or soy milk as a nut-free and vegan alternative., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Katie, , says:, , , , August 8, 2022 at 11:53 pm, , , , , Soo good!!

        "Vegan Sweet Mince Pie": "Ingredients: until it all comes together like a dough. Then you will need to sprinkle a little rice flour on your rolling surface (stops it sticking) and a little sprinkle on top of the dough\u2026, Rolling out your gluten-free vegan pastry, Use a rolling pin for this (a large round-sided glass jar might work too). Keep turning it after you roll to make sure it is rolled out evenly (add more sprinkles of rice flour if it gets sticky)\u2026, Use a metal spatula or cake slice to get underneath, if it starts getting too difficult to turn. It might get a bit fragile at this stage, in which case you can just squeeze any broken bits right back into the dough., Use a cookie cutter or the open top of a\u00a0glass to cut your shapes out. Scoop up with the metal spatula and pop them in your baking tray wells ready for the sweet mincemeat\u2026, I hope that helps give you a bit of a helpful visual guide., Baking your Gluten-free Vegan Mince Pies, You need to bake them for about 20 minutes. If they tan too much then it means that they are overbaked, and they won\u2019t taste so good. So keep your eye on them. They are not meant to be super tanned like wheat pastry (remember: chuck out old ideas of baking and these will work to perfection)., Gluten-free pastry can be a little crumbly when hot, so it is important that you let them cool down properly before eating them. They should firm up nicely upon cooling. They will also keep for a few days in the fridge., Share them with family and friends. If you don\u2019t have family and friends, then just share them with anyone, take them to a pot-luck, take them to work and you\u2019ll soon make new friends., My gluten-free vegan cookbook, On a final note\u2026 this recipe appears in my book \u201c, The KindEarth Cookbook, .\u201d Which I might add, makes an excellent xmas prezzie!, 168 pages fully colour printed book, Gluten-free, 100% plant-based, Jam-packed with the best recipes from kindearth.net, signed copies with international shipping, , Continue to Content, , , , Gluten-free Christmas Mince Pies (vegan with no refined sugar), , Yield:, , 12, , Prep Time:, , 10 minutes, , , Cook Time:, , 20 minutes, , , Total Time:, , 30 minutes, , Seriously\u200b the best homemade gluten-free sweet mince pies. Naturally vegan and sweetened with raisins and a dash of maple syrup., , Print, Sweet mince pie filling, 150g raisins (1 cup), 1 teaspoon lemon zest (loose), 1 lemon (medium sized), 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 tablespoon water, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (freshly grated), 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 tablespoon fresh ginger (loosely grated), Sweet mince pie pastry, 100g rice flour, 100g tapioca flour (or tapioca starch), 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed, 4 tablespoons coconut oil, 4 tablespoons maple syrup, several times during the soak period if you remember., Once soaked, the raisins will be plumper as it should have absorbed most of the soak liquid. Pulse the mixture with a hand blender a few times or use a regular jug blender - to create a rustic sweet mince 'mush'., Making the mince pies, Make sure the coconut oil is warm and melted., You will need a shallow cupcake tin with 12 cupcake indents., then the coconut oil may solidify... in which case, the warmth of your hands will help to keep it soft and pliable. After a couple of minutes you should get a nice dough ball., Sprinkle rice flour on your rolling surface and sprinkle a little rice flour on top of your dough (this helps it to stop sticking to the surface or to the rolling pin)., Roll the pasty with a rolling pin (or a large glass jar) and keep turning/rolling (which helps it roll evenly) until it is about 4mm thick. If the pastry starts falling slightly apart as it gets thinner, then just push it back together. I tend to use a super thin spatula or frying pan slice to slide under it and stop it sticking to the kitchen worktop at this stage., Cut out 12 circles with a cookie cutter (or the open end of a drinking glass works too)., Gently push each circle into the cupcake tin indents., Roll the remaining pastry and cut out 12 stars with it., Share the sweet vegan mincemeat mix between each pie and spread it fairly evenly., Put a star on top of each pie., Bake in a preheated oven (gas mark 5/ 375F/ 180C) for about 20 minutes., Once baked, allow to cool and serve. They should keep for at least a good few days in the kitchen or in the fridge too., Notes, TIP:, If you have spare pastry just roll it out and bake along side the jam tarts and enjoy as a cookie!, , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, Please leave a comment on the blog or share a photo on, Instagram, \u00a9 Anastasia, , , Cuisine:, dairy free, gluten free, vegan, healthy, , /, , Category:, Dessert, sweet treat, , Pin Gluten-free Vegan Mince Pies for later\u2026, , , By, Anastasia, |, Related Posts, , , , Super EASY roast squash & lentil curry, , , Super EASY roast squash & lentil curry, , April 9th, 2025, , |, , 0 Comments, , , Wild Garlic Recipes, , , Wild Garlic Recipes, , March 26th, 2025, , |, , 0 Comments, , , Wild Garlic Olive Tapenade, , , Wild Garlic Olive Tapenade, , March 26th, 2025, , |, , 0 Comments, 6 Comments, , , Jeanett, December 22, 2018 at 9:55 pm, - Reply, Dear Trinity,, I just tried the Christmas mince pies this morning and they taste just divine.

        "Vegan salted caramel apple pie": "Ingredients: , , Thank you Studio William for sponsoring this\u00a0recipe!, , What's better than a warm, comforting apple pie? Salted caramel apple pie, that's what., , I've been wanting to try this recipe out for a while now and always knew it would be good (how could caramel + apple pie not be good?) but after tasting it, I think it might be one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted!, , , Adding a dollop of coconut milk ice cream on top and a drizzling of my, 5-minute vegan salted caramel sauce, and I was in total heaven. YUM., , I'm a little disappointed that I didn't share this sooner this year because it would make the most amazing Thanksgiving dessert., , But, of course, it works wonderfully as a Christmas dessert too or just a great dessert all year round., , , Now onto the recipe..., , Please don't think that this apple pie is complicated because it really isn't., , The pastry can be whizzed up in a food processor, then it's a simple matter of splitting it in half and rolling out one piece for the bottom\u00a0of the pie dish and another for the\u00a0top., , This can also be done in advance., , Lattice and other decorative elements are, totally, optional, but again it's much easier than you'd think! I love this, simple lattice pastry tutorial., , , The caramel sauce really couldn't be any quicker or easier and I suppose the most time-consuming part is peeling and chopping the apples!, , As you can see, my apple pie isn't perfect but (and I know this sounds like a cop-out) it's not meant to be..., , Apple pie is a rustic, homey dessert and as long as it tastes good, then you're going to love it., , , Recipe FAQ, , Can I prepare this pie in advance?, , Yes. You can prepare the base crust in the dish, wrap with clingfilm and leave in the fridge for up to 2 days, or freeze for a couple of weeks., , The other half of the dough (for the top) will have to be chilled separately., , The filling can be made in advanced and chilled in the fridge for a couple of days, before adding to your prepared pie crust., , Can this recipe be used to make individual / hand pies?, , Apparently, yes! One or two readers have tried this with success. Reduce the baking time to about 20 minutes., , Why is there no sugar in the apples?, , Because they will be mixed with the caramel which already provides plenty of sweetness!, , , More Vegan Desserts, , Vegan Twix Tart, , Easy Plum & Almond Tart, , Vegan Baileys Ice Cream, , , , , , Continue to Content, , , , \ud83d\udcd6 Recipe, , , , , Vegan Apple Pie with Salted Caramel, , , , Yield:, , 8, , , , Prep Time:, , 25 minutes, , , , , Cook Time:, , 45 minutes, , , , , Total Time:, , 1 hour, , 10 minutes, , , , , , A drool-worthy apple pie filled with sweet salted caramel for an indulgent vegan dessert., , , , , , Print, , , , , , , , , 1 batch of my 5-minute caramel sauce, , , , For the pastry, , , 350 g / 2 \u00be cups plain flour, , 4 tbsp icing sugar, , 225 g / 8 oz dairy-free butter, I recommend Naturli block or Earth Balance Buttery, , 80 ml   cold water, , A small pinch of sea salt, , , For the apple pie filling, , , 1 kg / 2 lbs cooking apples, , 1 tsp ground cinnamon, , 1 tsp mixed spice, or pumpkin pie spice mix, , 1 tbsp corn starch, , , To serve (Optional), , , , Extra  caramel sauce, , , Vegan ice cream, , , , ,  Instructions: , Make the caramel, for how to make this quick caramel sauce., Make the pastry, Add the flour, icing sugar and dairy-free butter to a bowl and rub together with your fingertips (or use a food processor to gently mix) until well combined.

Don't worry about any overhanging pastry bits., Fill the pastry with the apple and caramel mixture so it's mounded on top., Now roll out the rest of the pastry and either lay on top and cut a hole in the centre, to allow steam to escape, or, create a lattice design, ., Trim the sides of the pastry to make it look neat and use any scraps to make designs (optional)., Bake for 35 minutes until golden brown. You may need to cover the top or sides with tin foil if it starts to brown too much, during baking., To serve, Leave to cool for at least an hour before serving, so the caramel can set and the pastry is easier to cut., (Optional) Serve with a dollop of vegan ice cream and extra, caramel sauce!, , , , , , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, , Please leave a comment, rate and share!, , , , , , , \u00a9 Aimee, , , Category:, Desserts, , , , , , , , , More Pies & Tarts, Nutty Vegan Mince Pies, Vegan Porkie Pies, Easy Vegan Jam Tarts, Indulgent Vegan Twix Tart, , , , 82.4K, , shares, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Reader Interactions, Comments, , , Leave a Reply, Cancel reply, Your email address will not be published., , Required fields are marked, *, Comment, *, , Name, *, , , Email, *, , , , , , \u0394, , , , , , , Mark mason, , says, , , April 21, 2020 at 2:02 pm, , , , Could I make this pie with puff pastry like apple turnover., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Aimee, , says, , , May 16, 2020 at 5:55 pm, , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Rebecca, , says, , , January 03, 2019 at 8:18 pm, , , , Is icing sugar Vegan?

The first time, I found it too sweet and the flavor of the maple syrup overpowered the spices. So I tried it again & used only a scant 1/4 cup syrup. I also had a bottle of orange blossom water I noticed when I got the vanilla out, so I put 1tsp of that in as well. I do not have ramekins so I made in in a small loaf pan, which worked fine.

Set aside to soak for 20-30 minutes., Once the cashews are done soaking, drain them and discard the soaking water., To a, high-speed blender, , add the soaked and drained cashews, coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, and optional sea salt. Blend until creamy and smooth. If needed, add more coconut milk 1 tsp at a time to encourage blending (we didn\u2019t need any), but avoid adding too much \u2014 you want the mixture to be thick., Divide the pudding between four 3-4 oz heatproof ramekins. We used shallow, wide ramekins that hold 4-5 ounces and added ~4 Tbsp per ramekin. It\u2019s rich! Set in the refrigerator to chill for at least one hour. At this point, the custard can be enjoyed without the br\u00fbl\u00e9e topping and/or can be kept covered in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days., TO BR\u00dbL\u00c9E: Just before serving, set out a baking sheet and preheat oven to a high broil. Place an oven rack on the very top shelf just below the broiler element, leaving just enough space to fit your baking sheet and ramekins., Place each ramekin on the baking sheet and top each one with 1/2 Tbsp cane sugar. Place the ramekins on the very top shelf of your oven just under the broiler for 1-2 minutes until the sugar is melted, bubbling, and turning brown. Watch carefully \u2014 it can burn in seconds. Alternatively, if you have a butane torch, you can use it to caramelize the sugar on top. Let cool for 5 minutes and enjoy. The top will stay crisp for up to 1 hour., , Video, , Notes, *We haven\u2019t tested with other dairy-free milks, but they might work.

If you prefer a ganache with less sugar it is totally optional and still delicious without the maple syrup added. Part of the reason I used maple syrup is that I used super dark chocolate. Lighter chocolate might already be sweet enough without maple syrup added in., , Also- make sure to use full-fat coconut milk so that the ganache actually firms up in the freezer while staying creamy! Lower fat coconut milk will become too icy (due to more water) and won't have the right texture for this vegan chocolate tart., , To make the chocolate ganache, , , , Freeze & top with flaky salt, , Since these vegan chocolate tartlets are a no-bake dessert, all they require is more freezing time once the tart is filled with the ganache., , To make a no-bake chocolate tart, I let the tarts sit in the freezer for 1-2 hours until the ganache firms.

Since the chocolate is warm, the dough will still be semi-sticky. Split the dough in half and gently press into the two tart pans. Place the pans into the freezer for 10-15 minutes to set., While the crust is freezing, make the chocolate ganache. Add the chocolate, coconut milk, coconut oil, and vanilla extract to a small saucepan and melt together over low heat. Watch carefully so the chocolate doesn't burn and stir constantly while the chocolate is melting. As a last step, add in the optional maple syrup and whisk in., Take the tart pans out of\u00a0 the freezer and fill with the chocolate ganache. Place the tarts back in the freezer for 1-2 hours until the chocolate ganache sets and hardens., Once the tarts are set, remove from the freezer and sprinkle with the flaky sea salt.

        "No-Bake Chocolate Cream Pie": "Ingredients: cacao powder, coconut oil, and salt. I used almonds, but any kind will work. You could even try hemp seeds or shredded coconut for a nut-free variation. I chose not to sweeten the crust since the filling is quite sweet, but you can add two tablespoons maple syrup if you want., , And don\u2019t forget to save about one half cup of the crust mixture for sprinkling on top!, , If you want a lower fat crust, try, THIS, one made with crispy rice cereal., , Or if you want an oil-free crust, you can make a date-based crust with 2 cups nuts (or even oats) + 1/2 cup cacao powder + about 10-12 pitted medjool dates blended until sticky. It will be more chewy and less cookie-like., , , The filling., The simplicity of this filling puts all other chocolate cream pies to over-complicated shame. Almond milk, dates, and unsweetened chocolate \u2013 that\u2019s it! The almond milk can be swapped for any kind of non-dairy milk, even coconut milk if you want it extra rich, but just the carton stuff (or homemade) is fine. The melted chocolate is what makes it rich and set in the fridge, so no you can\u2019t use cocoa powder here., , It\u2019s important to blend the dates and milk first until it\u2019s VERY smooth and chunk-free, then add the chocolate. We don\u2019t want the dates to even be detectable., , If you want a lower fat creamy chocolate dessert, try, THIS, one instead., , You can refrigerate or freeze this pie. From the fridge the texture will be softer, almost like pudding but still sliceable. Frozen it will be much more firm, and probably need about 10 minutes of thaw time before slicing., , , Happy pie no-baking to you!, , , Print, , , clock, , clock icon, cutlery, , cutlery icon, flag, , flag icon, folder, , folder icon, instagram, , instagram icon, pinterest, , pinterest icon, facebook, , facebook icon, print, , print icon, squares, , squares icon, heart, , heart icon, heart solid, , heart solid icon, , , , , , , No-Bake Chocolate Cream Pie, , , , , , \u2605, \u2605, \u2605, \u2605, \u2605, , 4.9, from, 24, reviews, , , , , , , , Author:, , Natalie, , , Prep Time:, , 30 minutes, , , Cook Time:, , 8 hours (chilling), , , Total Time:, , 8 hours 30 minutes, , , Yield:, , 8, slices, 1, x, , , Category:, , pie, , , , , , , Scale, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , , Crust*, , , 2 cups, (, 280g, ) almonds (or nuts of choice), , 1/2 cup, (, 40g, ) cacao powder, , 1/2 tsp, salt, , 1/4 cup, (, 50g, ) coconut oil, , , Filling, , , 12oz, , unsweetened chocolate, , 3 cups, (, 720g, ) non-dairy milk, , 1 cup, (, 180g, or 10-12) pitted medjool dates, , , , , , , , , , , , Cook Mode, , Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , , , , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Dee, , says, , , June 26, 2018 at 3:45 am, , , , I didn\u2019t understand your comment about coconut milk. Will full fat coconut milk work? Also, if you use coconut in the crust instead of nuts do you still use the same amount of oil?, Thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Natalie, , says, , , June 26, 2018 at 10:19 am, , , , This recipe is already quite rich so you don\u2019t need the higher fat content of coconut milk, but yes it will still work just fine. Your pie will just be extra luscious \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019d recommend the same amount of oil in the crust even with coconut, yes.

Love how you just piled it on for every single layer, haha, my kind of dessert! As soon as I saw your instagram video it reminded me of your chocolate melting pots and that is such a great idea to do a healthy filling as well for a chocolate cream pie! I love using chocolate bars for my raw dessert fillings because they set up so beautifully in the fridge and firm up nicely. I love how crunchy that crust looks too\u2026I think I could call that a dessert snack in itself and just happily munch on that stuff for days, hahaha. Would kind of be like a granola then \ud83d\ude42 I love that you added the extra crust bits on top too so that way you get that creamy and crunchy contrast going on that just sounds so darn heavenly to me right now!

We all devoured and raved and grew a little sad when we took our last bite. Was it rich? Absolutely! But that\u2019s how I love my chocolate-y treats!!! I wish I could have taken a video of everyone\u2019s faces when they saw the pie and then another of them eating it. This was pure decadent heaven!!!!! I had to make a couple of minor adjustments\u2026I didn\u2019t have enough almonds for the crust, so I ended up subbing in a cup of hazelnuts and man did that work perfectly!!!! We also couldn\u2019t find unsweetened baking chocolate last minute, so we used Theo\u2019s 85% baking chocolate bars\u2026which made the filling a little extra sweeter, but obviously no complaints here! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 This was a Father\u2019s Day success!

Can I substitute another type of oil in place of the coconut oil?  I know the coconut oil has a particular consistency.  Do you know how much regular oil I would use?  Would it be the exact same amount or not?  Thanks.  Ilia, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Natalie, , says, , , August 18, 2018 at 11:30 am, , , , Hi Ilia! Since coconut oil solidifies at fridge temp, other oils won\u2019t work the same to harden the crust without baking. I\u2019d try using nut butter instead of the oil. It will take slightly more though, probably 1/3-1/2 cup. That will be better for setting properly in the fridge than other oils.

Coconut oil turns solid at refrigerator temp unlike other oils which is what helps the crust set and slice easily. Grape seed oil won\u2019t do that so the crust will just be oily and fall apart.

Thanks for the kind words. I don\u2019t think you will be able to do a 1:1 substitution with whole wheat flour mainly because the protein content and fat content of almond flour is higher. But I would suggest you play around with the ration and see how the dough looks? Start with maybe 3/4 whole wheat to 1 almond flour?

        "Homemade Peanut Butter Cups": "Ingredients: these peanut butter cups are so easy to make and are completely gluten free, vegan, and refined sugar free. They\u2019re a healthy treat you can snack on all week long!, , , , How to make 3 ingredient peanut butter filling, , In my opinion, you can\u2019t just fill some chocolate with raw peanut butter and call it a day. Peanut butter cups must have that creamy but somewhat dry filling that\u2019s sweet but also packed full of peanut butter flavor. That\u2019s exactly what you can expect from these peanut butter cups, , The filling comes together in under 5 minutes and is made in a food processor. Here\u2019s all you need:, , , 4 large and pitted medjool dates, , 1/2 cup natural peanut butter, , 1/2 cup almond flour, , , That\u2019s it! The dates are what give the filling some texture and sweetness, while the almond flour helps thicken the mixture into a dough without completely drying it out., , , This dough is formed into small peanut butter \u201cpatties\u201d to prep for filling the cups., , , , , , , , , How to make peanut butter cups, , Once the peanut butter patties are formed, it\u2019s time to build these peanut butter cups. And just like the filling, I\u2019m also picky about the texture of the chocolate. When you sink your teeth into a Reese\u2019s peanut butter cup, the chocolate is just as smooth and soft as the filling. It\u2019s creamy and just melts in your mouth., , So for the chocolate in this recipe, it\u2019s melted down with more peanut butter and a bit of coconut oil. This not only creates a smooth and pourable chocolate, but it also gives these peanut butter cups that smooth and creamy chocolate shell., , To build these cups, start by lining a cupcake tin with, paper liners, . Then, fill the base of each liner with a spoonful of the melted chocolate. You may need to nudge it around a bit so that it completely covers the bottom., , Then place your peanut butter patties into the center of these chocolate pools and try not to let the peanut butter touch the sides of the liners. Otherwise, the peanut butter will peak through the sides once they\u2019re unwrapped., , Gently press the peanut butter into the chocolate, careful not to let it touch the very bottom. Then cover the cups with the rest of the chocolate and give the pan an gentle shake and tap to level them out., , Once filled, the cups are chilled for about an hour or until set. Unwrap the cups when they\u2019re firm and chilled, otherwise the paper will stick when they\u2019re at room temperature., , You can enjoy then cold and firm or at room temperature when they\u2019re nice and soft, just like a Reese\u2019s cup!, , , , What can I use instead of peanut butter?, , If you have a nut allergy but would still like to try this recipe, I highly recommend using a natural sunflower seed butter, made up of just sunflower seeds. It will still give you that creamy texture that\u2019s essential to any peanut butter cup., , Almond flour substitutions, , Your first option is to always use almond flour, but if you have a nut allergy you can sub in oat flour. Just know that it may give the filling a bit more texture., , What is the best type of chocolate to use?, , To make these completely refined sugar free, opt to use a dark or semi sweet chocolate that\u2019s sweetened with Stevia such as Lily\u2019s Chocolate. Otherwise, you can use any dark or semi sweet chocolate as long as it\u2019s dairy free!, , How long will these homemade peanut butter cups keep?, , Store the cups in an air tight container in the refrigerator and they should keep for up to 2 weeks., , , , For more delicious healthy dessert recipes, check out my:, , , Crunchy Peanut Butter Energy Balls, , Healthy Baked Oatmeal, , Brownie Cookie Dough Bars, , Blueberry Crumble Bars, , Zucchini Muffins, , Healthy Chocolate Chip Banana Bread, , , Make sure to tag me @butternutbakery on, Instagram, and comment below if you make these Homemade Peanut Butter Cups.

Flatten into small patties that are just a hair smaller than the diameter of the bottom of the cupcake liners. You should be left with 12-14 patties. Place them on a plate and set aside., , , Chocolate, , , In a heat-safe bowl, , Fill the base of each liner with a spoonful of chocolate, gently spreading it so that it completely covers the bottom of the liner., , Once all liners are filled, lay the peanut butter patties into the center of each liner. Gently press down but don\u2019t let it touch the bottom., , Cover the cups with another spoonful of chocolate and give the pan a gentle shake and tap to level out., , Place the pan in the refrigerator and chill for at least 1 hour or until completely set. If using sea salt, sprinkle on top when the cups are halfway through chilling., , Peel back the paper while the cups are still firm and cold. Enjoy chilled or at room temperature for a more Reese\u2019s-like texture., , , , , , Notes, , , DATES, \u2013 My favorite dates are from Trader Joe\u2019s because they\u2019re always really soft and sweet. But if you don\u2019t have a Trader Joe\u2019s near you or your dates are a bit dry, soak them in hot water for about 20 minutes before use. Then drain as much liquid as possible before blending. You may need to add a couple extra tablespoons of almond flour to make up for the added moisture, but only add the excess at the very end so you can assess how wet or dry the dough is first., , , , , , Prep Time:, , 20 minutes, , , , , , , , Did you make this recipe?, , Tag, @butternutbakery, on Instagram and hashtag it, #butternutbakery, , , , , , , Recipe Card powered by, , , Join, Our, Community, , , , , , Join me on Instagram, , , , , follow me on tiktok, , , , , , , Follow me on Pinterest, , , , , follow me on youtube, , , , , , , , , , Meet, Jenna, , I\u2019m the creator, baker, and photographer behind Butternut Bakery.
