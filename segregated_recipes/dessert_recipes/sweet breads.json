I made it again with 1 tsp bicarb, 2 tbs ginger, 1tbs cinnamon, 1tbs allspice, and I substited half the treacle with golden syrup. It came out great and colleagues were very happy!

Any idea what I\u2019m doing wrong?, , Reply, , Chris Mosler, , on September 5, 2019 at 2:16 pm, Hi Dee, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re enjoying the cake! A sunken cake could be one of three things \u2013 either the oven door has been opened before the cake is cooked through, it could be that the cake sat for a bit before going in or it could be that you have a bit too much raising agent in the mix. I would trouble shoot the first two and, if they don\u2019t work, I\u2019d reduce the bicarbonate of soda by maybe a 1/4 teaspoon and see if that helps. I would say, however, that if it has sunk a bit but it still tastes great I\u2019d probably just stick with it! Hope that helps \ud83d\ude42 x, , Reply, , Hazel, , on September 21, 2019 at 10:12 am, This sounds delicious but do you think it would work with gluten free flour please?, \ud83d\ude42, , Reply, , Chris Mosler, , on September 22, 2019 at 9:46 am, Hi Hazel, I haven\u2019t tried it with gluten free flour myself so I can\u2019t vouch for it working. However, it\u2019s got to be worth a go, this cake is delicious! If you\u2019re baking with gluten free flour make sure it is one which contains Xanthan Gum. I think I\u2019d add a bit more milk to the mixture and the cake might need a few extra minutes in the oven. Thanks for asking this question \u2013 I have a coeliac friend who would love this cake so I\u2019m going to give it a go gluten free myself \u2013 if you try it before I do, please let me know how you get on!

It is cooked apples that are then pureed. The apple sauce is used as an egg replacer, and for flavor. However,if you don\u2019t want to have to make apple sauce, you could use a different egg replacer, it just won\u2019t have as much apple flavor. A mashed banana would work, or a flax egg.

I used spelt flour because that\u2019s all I had.  Also I used  Myoko\u2019s cultured vegan butter.  I really want this tecipe to work.  Any advice on what I might have done wrong?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Lauren Hartmann, , , November 12, 2018 at 9:09 pm, , , , So, I wouldn\u2019t recommend replacing all purpose flour with spelt flour using a 1:1 ratio. I have not tried using spelt flour in this recipe, but I have done some research for ways to use it, and nothing I have seen replaces more than half of all purpose flour in a recipe. I think it is best with a blend. I also think for the best outcome adding xanthan gum is a good idea. Spelt flour doesn\u2019t have the same structure as all purpose flour and can make things very mushy, so I also always reduce the amount of liquid in a recipe. Have you used just spelt flour to replace all purpose flour with success? Anyways, I recommend using a gluten free baking blend and some xanthan gum if you are looking for a gluten free alternative.

Lauren, It would be helpful if you gave an amount in cups or grams/oz for, the apples because my idea of apple size must be different from yours\u2026lol, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s why it fell apart \u2013 too much apple. This probably caused additional moisture so, I had to keep putting it back in the oven at 5-10 minute increments. I too am a bit lazy so I partially, peeled the apples with a veggie peeler. Leaving a little skin on makes me feel like I\u2019m making it, more nutritious (Said while wearing my rose-colored glasses). Thanks, Lauren \u2013 I\u2019m not a great baker, and this was right up my \u2018difficult-level\u2019 alley., , , Reply, , , , , , , , moe, , , June 29, 2021 at 10:09 am, , , , Hi!, I made this over the weekend.  It was very good but I will make some changes.  Next time I will toss the apples in the apple pie mix before adding to batter.

        "Vegan Banana Bread": "Ingredients: but it just never came to that perfect, moist bread. The loaf kept ending up dry and soft, but a bit dense and even crumbly at times., , So one day, , I even realized that I could puree bananas and use that as an egg substitute \u2014 which works perfectly for, banana, bread. Well, I added just bananas, light, and soft eggless banana bread., , , Flour:, I have made the bread with organic whole wheat flour, but if you want you can make the bread with all-purpose flour or half-half of both the flours. You can also use cake flour or pastry flour., , Sugar:, You can use brown sugar, organic unrefined cane sugar or granulated white sugar \u2014 all work well in this recipe., , Oil:, You can use any neutral flavored oil for this recipe. I have made this bread on various occasions with a variety of oils, including coconut oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil and even olive oil., , Flavorings:, I added cinnamon powder, nutmeg, and vanilla extract to this vegan banana bread, but both the cinnamon and nutmeg are optional., , Sunflower Seeds:, I have added sunflower seeds in the bread to make it more\u00a0nutritious. However, you can easily skip adding them or add your favorite edible seeds or nuts., , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to make Banana Bread, , Prep Oven and Make Banana Puree, , 1. First preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 minutes. Next, while the oven is preheating, slice your ripe or overripe medium to large bananas into a mixing bowl., , Tip:, , I typically use about 4 medium or 2 large bananas for this recipe. In weight, the bananas (with their peels) are 300 grams or 10.5 ounces., , , , 2.\u00a0Then, add \u2153 to \u00bd cup sugar, depending on the sweetness of your bananas. Here I have used raw sugar, but feel free to add brown sugar, white sugar, coconut sugar, palm sugar, maple syrup or, jaggery, (Indian unrefined cane sugar)., , With palm sugar, coconut sugar, maple syrup and jaggery the flavors will be different., , , , 3.\u00a0Next, use a masher or fork to mash the bananas into a smooth consistency. If you prefer, you could also puree the bananas with sugar in a blender., , , , Tip:, , There should be no chunks left in the puree. However, fine threads of bananas in the mixture are fine., Additionally, you can use a blender to mash the bananas if needed., , , , 5.\u00a0Add \u00bd cup of oil to the mashed banana mixture. Use a neutral flavored oil, so that the after taste of oil is not felt in the bread. I prefer to use sunflower oil., , On various occasions I have also used coconut oil. But with coconut oil, on refrigeration the texture becomes dense as the coconut oil solidifies. So keep a note of this., , , , 6.\u00a0Now, stir briskly for about 2 to 3 minutes with a wired whisk or a spatula so that the oil mixes evenly with the banana puree., , , , 7.\u00a0Finally, stir in the following flavorings to your oil and banana puree:, , \u00bc teaspoon cinnamon powder (ground cinnamon), , 2 to 3 pinches or \u215b teaspoon of grated nutmeg or ground nutmeg powder, , \u00bd teaspoon vanilla powder or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, , Tip: That being said, both the cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder are optional., , , , 8.\u00a0Next, combine the flavoring spices and vanilla with the banana oil mixture. Stir and mix well!, , , , Make Banana Bread Batter, , 9. Sieve 1.5 cups whole wheat flour (about 180 grams), \u00bd teaspoon baking soda, 1.5 teaspoon baking powder and a pinch of salt directly in the bowl., , , , 10. Make sure the sieved dry mixture sits evenly on top of the wet mixture (pictured below)., , , , 11.\u00a0After that, , Tip: This folding step is most important \u2014 you want the whole bread mixture to be combined into one and mixed evenly, but you also want to avoid stirring because that will deflate the batter., , , , 12. The folded batter should be fully combined but not flat (pictured below) and will have a thick consistency., , Note 1: Ensure that you do not overwork the batter as this will cause gluten strands to form in the batter which result in a doughy texture after baking. The batter should have volume and not look flat or stringy., , Note 2: If in case the batter looks very thick or dry then add about \u00bc to \u2153 cup of water or preferred nut milk. Depending on the type of wheat flour, sometimes more liquids will be needed to get the right consistency., , , , 13.\u00a0This step is optional, but I always like the extra flavors nuts, seeds, , For this recipe, I included about 2 tablespoons of sunflower seeds, but you can also add chopped walnuts, chocolate chips or any dry fruit or nuts of your choice like I have done in the video., , , , 14.\u00a0Fold the batter gently once again until the sunflower seeds are fully incorporated., , , , Bake Eggless Banana Bread, , 15. Pour the batter into a greased or lined loaf pan (8 x 4 x 2.5 inches) or a round cake pan (8 x 2 inches). Bake at 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 to 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the bread comes out clean., , Tip:, , The temperature varies from oven to oven, so keep a close eye on your banana bread. Be careful NOT to open the oven until the bread is \u00be done., , When in doubt, use a skewer or toothpick \u2014 the benchmark is that a bamboo skewer inserted in the bread should come out clean with no wet or sticky batter clinging on it., , , , 16. Place the loaf pan on a wired rack for the bread to cool. When the bread cools down, then remove the loaf from the pan., , , , 17.\u00a0Slice and serve your Eggless Banana Bread\u00a0as is with tea or coffee or as a sweet snack., , The remaining loaf, you can wrap in a cling film or keep in an air-tight box in the fridge for about more than a week. Warm the bread before serving., , , , Expert Tips, , Warm before serving:, If coconut oil is added to the bread, it solidifies when refrigerated, hence the bread also becomes dense when you refrigerate it. So before serving just warm up the bread, and it will have its natural texture back., , Adjust sweetness:, Sweetness of the bread can be adjusted as per your preferences., , Keep it simple:, You can skip adding sunflower seeds., , Flour options:, I have made the banana bread with whole wheat flour, but if you want you can make it with all purpose flour or half-half of both the flours., , Bake time:, The timing varies from oven to oven. Depending on the temperature in your oven and the size of your pan, the bread\u00a0might take less or more time than what I have listed in this recipe., , FAQs, , Why didn\u2019t you use flax meal as an egg replacer?, , , , How long will does banana bread stay fresh?, , Your banana bread can last 1 to 2 days after baking if properly stored. Simply wrap your loaf in plastic wrap and leave it on the counter. In the fridge it will last for more than a week., , , Why do you recommend folding instead of whisking?, , you preserve more of the volume and will have a fuller banana bread., , , What bananas should I use?, , Banana bread is the perfect recipe to use when your bananas are past eating raw. I generally use overripe bananas \u2014 it\u2019s better to mash and make a delicious loaf of banana bread than waste bananas that are too brown to eat!, , , What is the difference between banana bread and banana cake?, , Banana bread comes under the category of sweet breads. Unlike a banana cake that is more sweeter with a light and soft crumb, a banana bread is less sweeter with a slightly denser crumb., , , , More Sweet Breads To Try!, Bread Recipes, Eggless Pumpkin Bread Recipe, Bread Recipes, Chocolate Chip Banana Bread, Bread Recipes, Chocolate Zucchini Bread (Eggless & Vegan), Bread Recipes, Eggless Donut Recipe (Cinnamon & Chocolate), , Please be sure to rate the recipe in the recipe card or leave a comment below if you have made it.

The batter should have volume and not look flat or stringy., If the batter looks very thick or dry then add about  \u00bc to \u2153 cup of water or preferred nut milk and gently fold again., Lastly add the sunflower seeds and fold once again., Pour the bread mixture into the loaf pan., Baking Banana Bread, Bake at 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit) for 30 to 40 minutes or till a toothpick or a bambook skewer inserted in the bread comes out clean., The timing varies from oven to oven. Depending on the temperature in your oven and the size of your pan, the bread might take less or more time than mentioned here., So take your call and keep an eye on the bread. However don't open the oven untill the bread is \u00be done., The benchmark is that a tooth pick inserted in the bread should come out clean., Place the loaf pan on a wired rack for it to cool. When the bread cools down, gently remove the banana bread from the pan., Slice and serve banana bread., The remaining banana loaf, you can wrap in a cling film or keep in a box in the fridge. You can choose to warm the banana bread before serving., , Video, , , , , Notes, If coconut oil is added to the bread, it solidifies when refrigerated, hence the bread also becomes dense when you refrigerate it. So before serving just warm up the bread and the bread will have its natural texture back., , Sweetness of the bread can be adjusted as per your preferences., , You can skip adding sunflower seeds. You can also choose to add nuts or edible seeds\u00a0 or dry fruits of your choice. Walnuts, almonds, cashews, pecans, pistachios, raisins, flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds are some good options., , I \u00a0have made the banana bread with whole wheat flour, but if you want you can make it with all purpose flour or half-half of both the flours., , Note that the approximate nutrition info is for 1 slice of banana bread made with sunflower oil and raw sugar., , , , Nutrition Info (Approximate Values), , Nutrition Facts, , Eggless Banana Bread Recipe (+ Vegan & Whole Wheat), , , Amount Per Serving, , , Calories, 206, , Calories from Fat 90, , , , , % Daily Value*, , , Fat, 10g, 15%, Saturated Fat 1g, 6%, Polyunsaturated Fat 1g, Monounsaturated Fat 8g, Sodium, 50mg, 2%, Potassium, 254mg, 7%, Carbohydrates, 29g, 10%, Fiber 3g, 13%, Sugar 13g, 14%, Protein, 3g, 6%, , , Vitamin A, 27IU, 1%, Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), 1mg, 67%, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), 1mg, 59%, Vitamin B3 (Niacin), 1mg, 5%, Vitamin B6, 1mg, 50%, Vitamin C, 3mg, 4%, Vitamin E, 4mg, 27%, Vitamin K, 1\u00b5g, 1%, Calcium, 31mg, 3%, Vitamin B9 (Folate), 16\u00b5g, 4%, Iron, 1mg, 6%, Magnesium, 35mg, 9%, Phosphorus, 103mg, 10%, Zinc, 1mg, 7%, , * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet., , , , , This Eggless Banana Bread post from the archives was first published on October 2012.

        "Peanut Butter Apple Crumble": "Ingredients: , Press, , Contact, , , , , Home, \u00bb, Recipes, \u00bb, Desserts, \u00bb, Fruit Desserts, \u00bb, Peanut Butter Apple Crumble (gluten-free, Vegan, Whole Grain), , , , , September 3, 2015, \u00b7, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, Rating: 5.0 from 3 reviews, \u00b7, Print Recipe, , , Peanut Butter Apple Crumble (gluten-free, vegan, whole grain), , , , Jump to Recipe, This peanut butter apple crumble has a delicious, natural peanut butter based topping and is incredibly simple to put together. Gluten-free, vegan, dairy-free and 100% whole grain., , This recipe actually started off as peanut butter apple crumb bars. But that got complicated. My choice was to either most likely attempt it another 3 times before giving up and feeling defeated OR I could just turn it into a crumble. I obviously decided to take the easy way out and am so thankful that I did because there\u2019s no way that bars could have beat these peanut butter crumbles!, , , I originally had a whole wheat topping, but then I saw a big bag of oat flour just sitting there and thought that the gluten-free folks may appreciate me using that. So now my gluten-free friends and my whole grain loving friends can be happy together (since oats are also whole grain!), , You can use four ramekins or two 5\u2033 tart dishes. The sides of my dishes were about 1\u2033 high. If yours are a lot smaller, then maybe divide the crumble between 2 tart dishes and a small ramekin. The recipe can easily be doubled or even quadrupled if you want a larger amount. Just be sure to refrigerate it to prevent the topping from becoming soft overnight., , , The first time I made this, I didn\u2019t add any cinnamon. I thought that peanut butter and maple syrup were too perfect together to mess with, but\u2026 the apple portion didn\u2019t taste like anything. The peanut butter topping, which is almost like a crumbly peanut butter cookie, totally overwhelmed it. So the next time, I added a little cinnamon., , With the cinnamon addition, they were perfect. But when I starting taking the pictures, I realized that the crumbles looked boring on their own and figuring that ice cream would perhaps be a strange combination (and not wanting to go to the grocery store), I chose to go the peanut butter route., , , These, no-bake peanut butter cookies, that I posted a few months ago are made by boiling peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla and coconut oil and tossing in some oats. Leave out the oats and coconut oil and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got on top of these crumbles! The only difference is that I added a little more maple syrup. The sauce was just too thick without it., , If you\u2019re used to my somewhat reduced sugar treats, don\u2019t be surprised when you take a bite of these peanut butter crumbles. They\u2019re sweet. As sweet as regular desserts. Especially with the added peanut butter maple sauce! I know some of you are going to feel compelled to reduce the sugar, but remember that you\u2019re likely going to affect the shape and structure of the crumbles. If you do experiment, let us know how it goes because I could always do with less sugar!, , \u2740, Peanut Butter Apple Crumble (gluten-free, vegan, dairy-free, 100% whole grain), \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, Rated, 5.0, by, 3, readers, Print, Prep Time:, 30 min, Cook Time:, 30 min, Ready in:, 1 h, Yield:, 3-4 servings, For the peanut butter topping:, 1/4 cup (64 grams) salted natural peanut butter, room temperature, 2 tablespoons (28 grams) coconut oil, 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon (17 grams) light brown sugar, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, 1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon (29 grams) oat flour (use, gluten-free oat flour, , if necessary), 1/4 cup (22 grams) rolled oats (use, gluten-free oats, , if necessary), 1/16 teaspoon baking powder, 1/16 teaspoon salt, For the apples:, 3 cups (350 grams) peeled, cored and diced apples (about 3 medium apples / 555 grams apples pre-coring and peeling), 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice, 2 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (or more, if desired), pinch of salt, For the peanut butter maple sauce:, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon salted natural peanut butter (the kind with just salt and peanuts), 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, Preheat the oven to 350 \u00b0F (175 \u00b0C) and grease two 5\" tart dishes., Divide the apple mixture between the two dishes. Top with the peanut butter topping., Place the crumbles on a baking sheet to catch any possible spills. Bake for 30 minutes or until the topping is firm and the apples have started to bubble lightly., Let cool for about 20 minutes before serving. Cover and keep at room temperature for up to 12 hours and then refrigerate (which prevents the topping from softening) for up to 3 days., Before serving, prepare the peanut butter maple sauce. In a saucepan, bring to a boil and while continuing to stir constantly, boil for about 30 seconds. It should have thickened a bit and should you have any leftovers after pouring it over your crumbles, will continue to thicken while cooling. The sauce will be too firm to pour at room temperature. To liquefy it again, reheat it on the stove over low heat, while stirring constantly, until liquid., Permalink:, https://www.texanerin.com/peanut-butter-apple-crumble/, Recipe by, Texanerin Baking, |, www.texanerin.com, Like what you see and want more?, Join over 12,400 readers and sweeten up, your inbox with new posts for free!, Your information will not be shared with or sold to a third party., This subscription is free of charge and can be canceled at any time., , , , , Posted by, Erin, in:, Dairy-free, , , Desserts, , , Fall Recipes, , , Fruit Desserts, , , Gluten-free, , , Seasonal Recipes, , , Special Diets, , , Vegan, , , , Like this post?

My measuring spoons go down to 1/32 teaspoon. Do you have 1/4 teaspoon? Just try to do 1/4 of that. It won\u2019t make a huge difference if you\u2019re off a bit.
