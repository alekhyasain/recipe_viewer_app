        "No Bake Brownie Bites": "Ingredients: walnuts, almonds, and cacao powder. Enjoy these raw brownie bliss balls for an afternoon snack, post-workout treat, or as a healthy dessert!, , , Looking to satisfy your chocolate cravings without steering far off your diet or spending a whole hour in the kitchen? I\u2019ve got you covered! If you\u2019re a fan of my, no bake vegan brownies, or, no bake turtle brownies, , you will adore these bite-sized brownie balls., , no eggs, and no refined sugar, the flavor of these brownie bites is not compromised one bit. Each chocolaty ball tastes like an indulgent treat!, , These, no bake brownie bites, are:, , , Vegan, raw, no-bake, gluten-free, dairy-free, and refined sugar-free, , Fudgy, chocolaty, soft, and chewy, , , Naturally sweetened with medjool dates, , Packed with antioxidants and healthy fats, , Kid-approved & great for school lunches, , Perfect for all chocolate lovers, , , , , , , Walnuts, : Walnuts are a great source of several nutrients, including iron, magnesium, copper, phosphorus, and vitamin B6., , Almonds, : Almonds are rich in healthy fats, antioxidants, vitamin E, manganese, and magnesium., , Medjool dates, : Instead of butter and sugar, these no bake brownie bites gain their fudgy texture and sweet flavor from medjool dates., , Cacao powder, : Both cacao powder and cocoa powder can be used in this recipe. However, cacao powder is higher in magnesium, iron, protein, and fiber., , Chocolate chips, : I recommend using vegan mini chocolate chips, but regular chocolate chips work just as well. Semi-sweet is preferable over dark chocolate., , Vanilla, : Don\u2019t skip out on the vanilla! Use a high-quality vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste. For vanilla bean paste, however, reduce the amount by half., , Salt, : A pinch of salt balances the rich, nutty, , , , How to make vegan brownie bites, , see the recipe card below., , The recipe begins by combining nuts, dates, cacao powder, vanilla, and salt in a food processor. After just a couple minutes of processing, , The fudgy brownie dough is then transferred to a bowl and combined with mini chocolate chips. Finally, the dough is rolled into bite-sized balls. It\u2019s that simple!, , , Tips to perfect this no bake brownie bites recipe, , Add water, if needed., The fudgy brownie dough is created by combining nuts, dates, and cacao in a food processor. While processing, eventually, form into a sticky dough. If your medjool dates are on the drier/harder side, you may have a difficult time achieving a sticky texture (it will be crumbly instead). If this issue arises, , Don\u2019t forget to remove the pits from your medjool dates, , , How to substitute dates?, Unfortunately, there is nothing quite like medjool dates in no bake dessert recipes. They provide the perfect texture and a deliciously sweet flavor. However, if it is very tough to find dates in your area, you can try replacing them with dried figs, raisins, dried cherries, or dried cranberries.

You can roll them as small or as a large as you want. You can roll it into 28 balls for 85 calorie and 8g sugar brownie bites instead. It depends on how big you make the balls. If you are unfamiliar with date balls, they are high in sugar because they contain, medjool dates, ., Medjool dates, have a high sugar content because it\u2019s a type of fruit. All fruit contains quite a bit of sugar. However, fruit also contains fiber which slows the absorption of sugar in the body.

That's awesome you and your husband love the recipe so much!  I can see how whole wheat would make the dough easier to handle, but much drier.  I add a bit of oat flour to my, homemade tortillas, and it makes the dough easier to roll and transfer to the pan without being dry.  I may have to test these out by replacing a bit of oat flour and see if it has the same effect while handling the dough.

Sorry if I am too late!  To answer you question, yes the dough should be fine to refrigerate overnight.  Just allow it to come to room temp before cutting and rolling it.  Also, you may want to \"punch it down\" a few times while it's in the fridge.  I'm so glad you guys are loving the recipe!! :), , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Jane2, , , January 02, 2019 at 4:51 am, , , , We made these for our New Years Party buffet and they were a big hit! We substituted around a cup of the white flour with spelt flour, and added more flour than the recipe called for, until we had a dough that was soft but not too sticky to handle. We used a mixer with dough hooks and with two of us working together it went really fast. We had pizza sauce for those who wanted to dip them. The bites were perfect, a beautiful golden brown color and delish! Thanks for the recipe., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Marlena Luna, , , January 02, 2019 at 12:25 pm, , , , Yay!

Nutritional yeast is an inactive yeast, therefore it won't make the dough rise. And non-rising dough means sad pretzel bites., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Elise, , , October 21, 2022 at 7:01 am, , , , I\u2019m hoping to make this tonight so hopefully you see this in time but can I used regular oil like vegetable instead of coconut?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Marlena Luna, , , October 21, 2022 at 9:47 am, , , , Hi Elise!

I have never tried using either of those flours for this recipe.  My experiences with bread making using GF flours haven't been very successful.

Is it pink curing salt or Himalayan sea salt? Also, good to know that the oil can be omitted. My uncle just recently turned vegan due to a strict diet, including eliminating certain omega fats (his body can't break them down causing blood clots), and coconut oil is a no for him. I definitely going to try these out for our family Christmas party so he'll be able to have munchies too., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Marlena Luna, , , December 07, 2016 at 9:01 am, , , , Hi Teanna! The pink salt I use in the dough is Himalayan pink salt.  You can use sea salt or any other salt you have on hand with no problem.  I hope your uncle enjoys them! :), , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Jane, , , October 31, 2016 at 2:05 pm, , , , Can coconut oil be repaced with flaxseed, auqafaba or something elses that is not oil???, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Marlena Luna, , , October 31, 2016 at 5:41 pm, , , , Hi Jane!  The oil in the dough can be omitted without a problem.  To top the salty bites, I'd suggest sprinkling salt on them immediately after they come out of the soda bath. That way they have a bit of moisture on them still, which will allow the salt to stick.   As for sweet bites, I've never experimented with anything other than oil.  I'd say try brushing the bites with either aquafaba or a non-dairy/maple syrup mix (2 Tablespoons non-dairy milk and 1 Tablespoon maple syrup) then coat in cinnamon and sugar.

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: , Making pretzel bites may seem intimidating, but they're actually pretty simple to make by following the steps below., , , , , Step 1:, Add the yeast to a bowl of warm water.  Set aside to activate and become foamy., , , , , Step 2:, Pretzel Dough, Start by warming your water. You want it to be warm to the touch, but not hot., Pour the warm water into a large bowl and mix in the sugar. Then sprinkle the yeast on top. Cover and let sit for 10 min to activate the yeast., Once the yeast is foamy, mix in the salt and coconut oil., Now, slowly mix in 2 cups of flour. Once it is well blended, mix in the 3rd cup of flour. If the dough is too sticky to handle, mix in enough flour from the 4th cup until you can handle the dough., On a clean lightly floured surface, knead your dough for 3-5 min adding more flour as needed. You shouldn't need more than 4 cups of flour. The dough should be slightly sticky., Shape the kneaded dough into a ball and place it in a large oiled bowl. Cover and set in a warm place to rise for 15-20 minutes., Meanwhile, line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set them aside. Then preheat your oven to 450\u00baF and heat the water for the baking soda bath., Once the dough has risen a bit, cut it into 8 triangles, as you would a pizza., With your hands, roll each triangle out to an 18-inch-long rope. Cut each rope into 8-9 (2-inch) bites., Baking Soda Bath, Once the water is boiling, lower the heat. When the water stops boiling add 3 Tablespoons of baking soda., Turn up the heat to simmer the water, then place about 10 bites in the bath. Let them soak for 20-30 seconds. Once they \"puff up\" a bit remove the bites from the bath and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet until it's full. Be sure not to crowd your baking sheet., Bake at 450\u00baF for 10-12 minutes, or until the tops are nice and brown. Keep an eye on them at about halfway through because they will darken quickly., Cinnamon & Sugar Coating, In a bowl mix the cinnamon and sugar. Set aside., Lightly brush each bite with just enough coconut oil to allow the sweet coating to stick., Roll in the cinnamon and sugar mix until coated., Coarse Sea Salt Topping, Brush the tops of each bite with coconut oil, then sprinkle with coarse sea salt., , , Notes, , If the dough ropes keep shrinking, while rolling them out, let them rest for 3-5 minutes before continuing to roll the full length., , To Store:, If you don't plan on eating all the bites right away, I suggest topping only what you're going to eat.\u00a0Store leftover, cooked bites in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 10 days. Or the freezer for up to 3 months.\u00a0When ready to eat, preheat your oven to 350\u00baF and bake for 5-10 min.\u00a0Add sweet or salty toppings to the bites after baking., , To twist a full pretzel, , twist the ends of the dough rope together once. Bring the twisted ends down to the curved bottom. Add a bit of water to get the ends to stick to the dough. Gently place the shaped pretzel in the baking soda bath one at a time., , , , Nutrition, Serving:, 2, bites, |, Calories:, 23, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 4, g, |, Protein:, 1, g, |, Sodium:, 191, mg, |, Sugar:, 1, g, , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Marlena Luna, , , October 05, 2017 at 2:53 pm, , , , I'm so glad you were able to fix it, Michelle!

Flavoring them in a variety of different ways - Orange, Peppermint, and Turkish Coffee being my go-to's - I have found these are the perfect, homemade gift, for friends and family during the holiday season. They are decadent, delicious, and (surprisingly) pretty easy to make. Yay!, , , Chocolate Chips, - It is important to get quality chocolate. It should be high in cocoa percentage (at least 70%), bittersweet or semi-sweet, and should be made with few, Coconut Mik, - Use a high-quality full fat, canned, coconut milk., Coconut Oil, , Recommended Equipment, , For this recipe, you will need basic cooking equipment including a, saucepot, , a, medium bowl, , , baking sheets, , and, utensils, . I highly also recommend, silicone baking mats, to prevent the truffles from sticking., (<<affiliate links), , , Check out the full list of my, recommended kitchen tools and gadgets, ., , How to Make Vegan Chocolate Truffles, , Step One - Make the Chocolate Ganache., , These delicious vegan chocolate truffles are made with a base of rich and creamy chocolate ganache. Creating the perfect ganache is key to this recipe., , Classic chocolate ganache is a combination of chocolate and cream that can be used as a glaze, a filling for cakes and tarts, or rolled into chocolate truffles. The ratio of chocolate and cream depending on, how, you use the ganache., , , , Place the chocolate chunks in a shallow bowl. In a small saucepan, gently heat coconut milk to a scald. Basically, you are looking for a thin skin to form on top of the milk. Bubbles will be starting below the surface, but you do not want it to get to the point that they are breaking through. This will burn the chocolate., , Quickly removed the milk from the heat and pour evenly over the chocolate chips. With a rubber spatula, gently stir together the ganache in a folding motion, from top to bottom. This will take about 2-3 minutes. At first, it will look lumpy but keep up with the gentle folding. Eventually, it will come together. Once this happens the ganache will get dark brown and very smooth. Be careful not to over mix. The least amount of agitation to the chocolate, the better., , Now we need to let the chocolate set. Once it's evenly mixed, cover the ganache and let it sit for at least 6 hours (overnight is best) until the chocolate is thick and moldable., , Step Two: Roll out the Truffles, , One the ganache is set, it's time to shape the truffles. Using a small scoop, ,, scoop out the truffles and place them on a parchment-lined paper. Once all the ganache has been scooped into truffles, place the baking sheet in the freezer and let the truffles freeze for at least two hours., , Step Three - Melt the Chocolate, , In a double boiler - which you can make with a sauce pot and a metal bowl gently heat the remaining chocolate with 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. Do not stir the chocolate more than necessary - this will agitate it. Just let the steam slowly melt the chocolate so that it is shiny and pourable., , Step Four - Dip the Truffles, , When the truffles are frozen and the chocolate is melted, insert a toothpick into the truffle and dip it completely in the melted chocolate. Let the excess chocolate drip off and transfer it back to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with all the truffles until they are all coated in chocolate. While the chocolate is still a little wet, top with desired toppings., , Let the chocolate set completely before serving., , , Serving and Storing, , Serving, - Vegan truffles are a wonderful homemade holiday gift. I love to grab a handful of gift boxes and give them to my friends and family during the holiday season. Truffles are also a nice treat to bring out during holiday gatherings., , Storing, - Let cool at room temperature until the outside chocolate is completely set. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 7 days., , Tips and Tricks, , Don't over-mix the chocolate at any point., Chocolate does not want to be messed with much. When mixing the ganache and chocolate, mix it only as much as necessary. Gentle heat will do most of the work itself., Don't burn the chocolate., When melting the chocolate in the double boiler, make sure that the chocolate is only melting from the steam in the pot. Too much heat will burn the chocolate immediately., Make sure your truffles are completely frozen, before dipping them. If they are not, they will start to fall apart in the chocolate making your chocolate cold and clumpy., Don't refrigerate set chocolate., Once the truffles are dipped, the chocolate should set at room temperature. Refrigeration can cause condensation and the chocolate will become wet and lose its flavor., Flavor them as you please, (there are a few suggestions below) and top them when the chocolate is still a bit wet so that the toppings stay on your truffles, , , More Vegan Candy Recipes, , Classic Peanut Brittle, Pumpkin Chocolate Fudge, , , , , , , 3-Ingredient Vegan Chocolate Truffles, , , Make your Christmas chocolates at home with this simple 3-ingredient Vegan Chocolate Truffle recipe.

Place 12 ounces of vegan chocolate chips in a, medium bowl, and set aside., In a small saucepan heat the coconut milk to a scald (just before boiling point). A skin will form over the top and the sides will begin to simmer. Remove hot cream and pour immediately over the chocolate chips. Cover for 3 minutes. Remove lid and stir together with a spatula until the chocolate and cream come together to create a homogeneous thick sauce. Do not over mix! Cover and allow the ganache to set up at least six hours or overnight., When the ganache is hard, roll mounded teaspoon size balls and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a, silicone baking mat, . Freeze for at least 2 hours., In a double boiler, gently melt the chocolate and coconut oil until smooth. Insert a toothpick into a frozen truffle and dip into the chocolate. Allow excess chocolate to drip off before placing truffle back on parchment-covered baking sheet to harden.

Thanks for all of the awesome recipes., , Although my eating habits have definitely diversified since I've started eating a vegan diet, there are two desserts that I've been unable to enjoy as a vegan: tiramisu (how to mimic the mascarpone cream?) and highland shortbread (rounds edged with coarse sugar). The latter hold a special place in my heart due to childhood memories of enjoying them with the Scottish side of my family. I've tried to replicate 'Highlanders' with Earth Balance but they ended up tasting really 'off', for lack of a better explanation. Any suggestions on how to veganize these desserts would be greatly appreciated!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Sarah, , says, , , February 28, 2014 at 8:04 am, , , , I'm working on a tiramisu recipe right now so once I've figured it out, I'll let you know. All I know is the mascarpone cream needs to be made out of cashews for equal creaminess and richness. As for the shortbread cookies, I know what you're talking about, but have never had one. I don't actually know what would be better than earth balance in terms of getting the right taste. You could try making your own vegan butter, you'll find recipes for that if you google it. Perhaps the flavor of those butters will improve the overall cookie. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Geanna, , says, , , January 09, 2013 at 11:46 pm, , , , These are so easy, and so good!!

Do you leave it out at room temperature or in the fridge?  Thanks!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Sarah, , says, , , January 09, 2013 at 5:35 pm, , , , Let the ganache set up at room temperature. The time it takes will vary because of a number of factors but you want to wait until it's easily moldable by hand to roll into balls, which will be at least 6 hours.

I did cut the bananas in 1 \u2013 1 1/2\u2033 pieces which I think prevents that, but I did use bananas that were a little more ripe than recommended in the recipe.

Read my, disclosure policy, ., , , , , These pan fried cinnamon bananas are soooooo good! They only take a few minutes to make and they transform boring old bananas into a drool-worthy snack or dessert. I eat my pan fried bananas all on their own, but they would taste amazing (seriously AMAZING) served over ice cream. Or you could eat them with yogurt. Or even on french toast or pancakes. They\u2019re caramelized\u00a0on the outside with a soft and sweet inside and make a great dessert topping. Yum!, , My family goes bananas for bananas. (Sorry, I had to do it\u2026). It shocks me how many bananas we go through in our house. Bananas might be one of the most boring foods out there\u2026 in my opinion anyway. But they are one of those foods that everyone will eat. Not everyone necessarily loves them, but pretty much everyone in our house will eat a banana without complaining., , I\u2019ll be the first person to admit that I\u2019m not the biggest banana fan, or at least not the biggest raw banana fan. Sure, I\u2019ll eat them cut up in my bowl of Cheerios, or along with a spoonful of peanut butter when I need to curb my appetite. But I don\u2019t usually look at the bananas sitting in our fruit bowl on the counter and think to myself, \u201cMmmmm\u2026 bananas\u201d. (But that\u2019s probably because I\u2019m already heading towards the cookies\u2026 I really need to work on that\u2026), , I think I need to change the way I think about bananas, because do you know what I DO love? Cooked bananas. Man oh man, I\u2019m not sure what happens to bananas when they get heated up, but WOW, they start to taste sooooo good! Once they hit the frying pan they go from a \u201cMeh\u201d fruit to an \u201cOhhhhhh, yes!\u201d dessert. They get super sweet, and almost tangy. From boring to amazing in just a few minutes!, , , Stay with me for a second\u2026 I was supposed to make homemade laundry detergent for the blog today. I have all the supplies ready to go, and I was feeling a little overwhelmed at the thought of starting a project that was going to take 4 to 6 hours to finish. It\u2019s been one of those days where I\u2019ve been sitting in my office chair, staring at my laptop, waiting for something more exciting to happen, CONVINCED that if I stare at the screen for just another 5 minutes, something amazing is\u00a0going to happen (so far, it still hasn\u2019t happened, but I\u2019ll keep waiting\u2026)., I just wasn\u2019t feeling the vibe for a difficult project today. So I can assure you that these pan fried bananas are quick and EASY! They totally satisfied my laziness for the day! And on top of being easy, they reminded me of the pan fried bananas my mom used to make when I was growing up. So good! So the treat was worth it!, , Check out our video for how to make pan fried cinnamon bananas:, , , , , , , , , , , Pan Fried Cinnamon Bananas, , The full printable recipe is at the bottom of this post, but here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:, , , Bananas, , Butter, , Cinnamon, , Honey (I used raw honey, but regular honey works just as well), , , The bananas I used were JUST ripe. You can see in the photo below that they are just starting to get very faint brown spots on them. Under ripe bananas would work well in this recipe too, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend using overripe bananas. The bananas get softer when you cook them, so over ripe bananas would\u00a0get really mushy., , , Add the honey, butter and cinnamon to a frying pan., , , Then heat them up until they are completely combined., , , Add the bananas and cook over medium-high heat until they\u2019re browned. You might have to adjust the temperature and cooking time\u00a0a bit as you go. You don\u2019t want them to burn, so make sure you keep a close eye on them as they cook., , , After about 4 or 5 minutes of cooking, flip them over and continue to cook the other side. Make sure you move them around the pan so they soak up some of that yummy\u00a0cinnamon sauce., , , These are definitely best when they\u2019re served hot. I sprinkled them with some sugar and ate them straight off the plate., , , They would taste amazing on vanilla ice cream. I don\u2019t have any ice cream in the freezer right now, but just writing this post and looking at all the photos is making me crave vanilla ice cream with pan fried cinnamon bananas on top. I\u2019ll have to go out and buy some when I pick up the kids from school and daycare.\u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure no one will complain about stopping for ice cream!, , , I find the cinnamon adds a great depth to the flavour, but if that\u2019s not your thing, you can definitely leave it out. The sweet bananas taste amazing on their own\u00a0without any spices. My mom actually used to fry up bananas in\u00a0concentrated orange juice (like a few spoonfuls of the frozen stuff, straight from the can), and they were sooooooo good!, , , , , , , Print, , 4.93, from, 14, votes, , , Pan Fried Cinnamon Bananas, , Soft and sweet on the inside and caramelized on the outside., , Prep Time, 2, minutes, , minutes, Cook Time, 8, minutes, , minutes, Total Time, 10, minutes, , minutes, , Servings:, 2, , -4 servings, , , , Combine the cinnamon, butter and honey in a frying pan over medium-high heat until melted and combined., Add the banana slices and cook for 4 minutes until the bottoms start to caramelize and turn golden brown.

They\u2019re amazing (seriously AMAZING) on ice cream or pancakes, or just as a snack. Soft and sweet on the inside and caramelized on the outside.
