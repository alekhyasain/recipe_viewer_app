Why on earth are these cupcakes baked SO VERY LONG\u2013and at a higher than typical temperature to start?!?!  I\u2019ve NEVER baked ANY home made cupcake\u2013vegan or not\u2013for nearly that long.  Mine bake up in 19-22 minutes at 350\u00b0F.  Please explain so I don\u2019t waste time, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Gretchen, , , August 6, 2018 at 9:53 pm, , , , Hi Christine, I like to start cupcakes at a higher temperature because that helps them get a nice jump on the rise. (I find vegan cupcakes especially need a little boost in that area) Once you open the preheated oven to place the cupcakes (or cake) you lose almost 30\u00b0F temperature right off the bat., But if you feel better about baking them at 350 the whole time, that is totally fine, I am sure by what you wrote you have quite alot of knowledge as to knowing when your cupcakes are done, so you can use the 20 minute mark as a time to check them and see if they need another couple minutes., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Dana, , , February 1, 2019 at 5:43 pm, , , , Could I sub organic shortening for the butter in the frosting?

They sunk in the middle, making them a bit gooey, brownie-like in texture. They still tasted great, actually, but I made them for a friend\u2019s birthday and I couldn\u2019t give them to her. So not only did I spend time and money making them, I had to make a different cupcake afterwards. I am an experienced (vegan and non-vegan, once upon a time) baker, and I\u2019m not sure what went wrong here. It seemed to me that there wasn\u2019t enough flour to prop up all the fat in these cupcakes., , I\u2019ve made other recipes by Gretchen, and they\u2019ve turned out great, but this one didn\u2019t work for some reason. I\u2019ll just console myself by eating the crunchy edges off these cupcakes and dreaming of how to make this flavor work in the future!

As someone else commented, mine also sunk in the middle. My first thought was maybe my butter was too soft and/or maybe I incorporated too much air that couldn\u2019t be supported. So I tried again. Creamed butter and sugar just until fluffy and followed the video exactly for the pb and flax egg. The same scoop gave me a higher weight per cupcake. I was super hopeful as they were still slightly rounded at the end of the time. They had the right feel to the tops so I took them out and instantly deflated, again! I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening. Sadness, as the flavour is great, but texture is so gummy after sinking. I can see what they WANT to be in parts of the cupcake and there is fluff, but not enough structure to hold them up. Would more gluten formation help, maybe?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Gretchen, , , May 9, 2023 at 10:46 pm, , , , Hi Heather!

Although I am not an avid gluten free baker I have learned that by allowing the batter to sit for about 15 minutes before baking will help the final texture, As well as baking several minutes longer (even possibly up to 10 minutes longer for cupcakes!) than the recipe specifies, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , In\u00eas Nobre, , , December 18, 2024 at 9:28 am, , , , Hi Gretchen, love your recipes, i don\u2019t do vegan, but i loved your peanut butter cupcakes recipe, from the non vegan days, i can\u2019t find the recipe on the other site, but i was wondering how many eggs to substitute the flax seed, 3/4?

The tops should spring back quickly when pressed lightly and a cake tester should come out clean., Remove from oven, let cool in pan for about 5 minutes and then remove to a cooling rack. Let cool COMPLETELY before icing., For the CARAMEL SAUCE, In a 3 quart saucepan over medium heat combine the sugar and the water., Stir to dissolve the sugar just until the mixture comes to a boil., Once the mixture begins to boil STOP stirring!, Watch the pot carefully as the sugar will suddenly be ready. Let the pan boil and as the water cooks off, the sugar will begin to brown., Once the sugar mixture is a medium brown/caramelly colour remove the pot from the heat and pour in the coconut milk and vanilla., Be careful of the spatter! It's normal and VERY hot! If the sugar mixture seizes from the cool milk simply return the pot to low heat to re-melt it., Stir the pot (over low heat if the sugar is stiffened) until the mixture is smooth., Stir in the vegan butter and salt, and stir until it's completely combined., Set aside to cool., For the ICING, Cream butter and vanilla together until creamy with electric mixer, Gradually add the icing sugar, beating after each addition., Add in the caramel sauce and beat to combine., Add milk 1 tsp at a time, beating after each addition, until you achieve a soft spreadable consistency. If too thick, add more milk, if too thin add more icing sugar., Add in the salt and mix to combine. Taste and decide if you want it saltier or caramelier (is that a word?). Add more salt or caramel to taste and mix., ASSEMBLY, Once the cupcakes have cooled, spread or pipe icing on each. I find that vegan butter is super melty so if it gets too soft you may have to return the cupcakes to the fridge to firm up., Drizzle some caramel sauce over each cupcake, Sprinkle a tiny bit of sea salt on the tops of each cake., Serve and impress!!, , , Notes, You can use melted coconut oil in the cupcake batter, but if you do you have to be sure your milk is room temperature so the coconut oil doesn't solidify as you're mixing it., , Also, I find that vegan butter is super melty, so storing these cupcakes in the fridge is a good idea. You may even need to chill the icing if you're using a piping bag because the heat of your hands will warm it up quite a bit., , , , , , , If you make this recipe,, please remember to comment/rate below!!, Thanks! \ud83d\ude00, , , , , Share this:, Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window), Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window), Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window), Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window), Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window), Click to print (Opens in new window), , , You might also like...., , , , , Author:, Crystal, , Filed Under:, Breads/Buns/Baked Goods, , , Recipes, , , Sweets, , Tags:, buttercream, , , caramel, , , coconut milk, , , cupcakes, , , salted caramel, , , Vegan, , , , , , , , Tofu Tikka Masala, , Salted Vegan Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies, crispy AND chewy!, , , , , , 11 thoughts on \u201cVegan Salted Caramel Cupcakes\u201d, , , , , , , Mon, , says:, , , , 10 August 2017 at 7:34 AM, , , , , So yummy!

I had never forgotten this one. I used to make a few changes and make this no bake biscuit cake on occasions., , After several requests from readers for a no-bake cake made with biscuits (known as cookies in the US and other regions), I am sharing this foolproof recipe that\u2019s a hit every time., , Speaking of, here are two more recipes for desserts that use biscuits and crackers on the blog:, , , Cheesecake, , Mango Cheesecake, , , Likewise, this chocolate biscuit cake is easy to prepare with nearly any sweet biscuit you like. I use glucose biscuits, but feel free to make no-bake cookie cake with Marie biscuits, your favorite digestive biscuit, or sweet crackers., , The taste is similar to a traditional chocolate cake, but has a slightly firmer and more tender texture. Biscuits are briefly soaked in coffee, then layered with a delicious chocolate sauce., , I have prepared the sauce with Cadbury\u2019s Bournville raisin and nut chocolate for even more deep flavor. You can also use Cadbury\u2019s Dairy Milk Chocolate, couverture, or compound chocolate, if you prefer. (, However, do not use Cadbury\u2019s Silk Chocolate. It does not work well for a smooth chocolate sauce., ), , Keep reading for the simple steps to prepare the best no bake biscuit cake!, , , , Step-by-Step Guide, , How to make Biscuit Cake (No Bake), , , Preparation",

        "Vegan Cheesecake": "Ingredients: while quite simple, can get a little expensive., , So it\u2019s probably not what you\u2019re going to make every other week but it\u2019s rich as heck so that\u2019s another reason you\u2019re probably not going to make it every other week., , Of course if you love a good cheesecake then also check out our delicious, baked cheesecake recipe, !, , , , How To Make No-Bake Vegan Cheesecake, , , If you happen to forget to soak them, , then all is not lost. Place the cashews in a bowl, pour over boiling hot water from the kettle and leave them to soak for, at least, , an hour, for this recipe. Soaking in hot water reduces the time needed. But any less than an hour will not be adequate because of the volume of cashews that you need to blend., , Be patient., The hands on time for this recipe is actually really short, a bit of processing, a bit of blending, a bit of stirring, really it\u2019s too easy! The, time consuming part is waiting for it to set, , which takes quite a few hours in the freezer, and you need it to set completely before you remove it from the spring form pan. So you need a bit of patience with this pie, but otherwise it\u2019s really easy and fun., , , Vegan Cheesecake Q&A, , What can I use instead of macadamias for the pie crust?, , Walnuts work extremely well for the crust too. Walnuts or macadamias are my usual favorites for a nut/date crust, but nut/date crusts are actually really flexible and forgiving, you can try other nuts or a combination of nuts and it will usually work well., , , Can I leave out the coconut in the pie crust?, , Yes you can! I like it because it creates delicious flavor and texture but I have definitely made pie crusts without coconut, you can simply leave it out or add more nuts to compensate., , , What can I use instead of\u00a0coconut butter\u00a0for the caramel sauce?, , Coconut butter\u00a0is really the key ingredient in this caramel sauce. And just to be clear it\u2019s nothing like any other nut butter and it\u2019s also nothing like vegan butter. So you can\u2019t switch it for either of those. If you can\u2019t get\u00a0coconut butter, you could switch the topping to something else completely, or you could, make your own coconut butter, from\u00a0dessicated coconut\u00a0(also known as finely shredded coconut or sweetened coconut flakes)., , , , , Storing and Freezing, , Keep your cheesecake stored, in the coldest part of your refrigerator and serve it cold straight from the fridge. It must set in the freezer but thereafter can be stored in the coldest part of your fridge for around 5-7 days., , You can also store it in the freezer, in which case you will need to let it thaw at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving. If you store it in the freezer then it will of course last much longer than if it is stored in the fridge., , , More Delicious No-Bake Vegan Desserts, , Vegan Pumpkin Cheesecake, Vegan Chocolate Tart, Vegan Banoffee Pie, Vegan Peanut Butter Pie, Vegan Chocolate Pie, Vegan Key Lime Pie, , , , Did you make this recipe?

Set aside., Add macadamia nuts, pitted dates and dessicated coconut to a food processor and process into a sticky dough., Place into the prepared springform pan and press down firmly into a pie crust. Place into the freezer to set while you work on the filling., Add soaked cashew nuts to a blender jug along with water, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, lemon juice and vanilla and blend until very smooth., Pour this out over the top of the crust in the springform pan and smooth down with the back of a spoon. Place into the freezer to set (around 4-6 hours)., When the cheesecake has set completely, remove it from the springform pan and place onto a cake stand while you prepare your salted caramel topping., For the topping, mix together melted coconut butter, maple syrup, vanilla extract and sea salt., Spread it out over the top of your cheesecake, add a few sprinkles of sea salt over the top and a few macadamia nuts to decorate and you have the perfect cheesecake., Let the cheesecake thaw on the countertop for around 30 minutes or so before serving., , , The Caramel Fudge Topping, , I was at first going to make a, vegan dulce de leche, for the topping, but at the last minute, had a change of heart., , I was thinking, why, cook, a topping when you\u2019ve got this whole no-bake thing going on, why go and stand over a hot stove just for the sauce?, , So I decided on a salted caramel fudge topping made from melted coconut butter, maple syrup, vanilla extract and sea salt and it turned out to be, the, perfect topping., , , Recipe Tips, , Soak your cashews., It\u2019s important to soak your cashews for this recipe. Ideally, soak them overnight. Place them in a bowl, pour over water, cover and leave them to soak overnight. Then drain and rinse before using., , The reason it\u2019s important to soak them first is that you use a ton of cashews for this cheesecake filling, Spray an 8 inch round springform pan with non-stick spray and line the bottom with parchment paper. Set aside., Add the macadamia nuts, pitted dates and dried dessicated coconut to the food processor and process until it starts to form into a sticky dough. It will start off crumbly, keep going until it starts to clump together in sticky clumps. Transfer to the springform pan and smooth it down into a pie crust. Use the back of a spoon to press it down into a neat flat layer. Place into the freezer to set., Take your soaked and rinsed cashew nuts and place them into the blender jug. Add the water, maple syrup, melted coconut oil, lemon juice and vanilla extract and then blend everything together until very smooth. Stop and give your blender a break as needed as this is a lot of volume to blend up. Pour this over the macadamia crust and smooth down with the back of a spoon. Return to the freezer to set completely \u2013 about 4-6 hours., When the cheesecake has completely set, remove it from the springform pan and put it onto a cake stand to do your topping., Add the melted coconut butter, maple syrup, vanilla extract and sea salt into a bowl and stir it together into a caramel sauce. Spread this out over the top of the cheesecake, working quickly, as the sauce thickens and sets quite fast when in contact with the cold cheesecake., Decorate the cheesecake with sprinkles of sea salt and some macadamia nuts., Allow the cheesecake to thaw at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving., Once the cheesecake is thawed, keep it stored in the refrigerator or freezer*., , Video, , Notes, , Walnuts work great as an alternative to macadamias for the crust., , Half a cup of medjool dates (packed) is approximately 10 pitted medjool dates., , Dessicated coconut is also called finely shredded coconut or finely shredded coconut flakes. It\u2019s dried coconut that is shredded very finely., , If you forget to soak the cashews overnight, then you can take a shortcut. Place the cashews into a bowl and pour over boiling hot water from the kettle. Leave them to soak for 1 hour. Soaking in hot water reduces the time needed for soaking. It is still more ideal to soak them overnight for this recipe though., , The topping must be made with coconut, butter, and not coconut oil. If you can\u2019t easily find coconut butter you can also, make your own, . It\u2019s super easy and fun to make., , Prep time does not include time spent setting in the freezer., , If you know when you\u2019re going to be serving this cheesecake, you can keep it in the freezer until you need to serve it and then let it thaw at room temperature and serve. From then on, if stored in the refrigerator, the texture can become a little softer, so you might prefer to let it firm up in the freezer again before serving., , This recipe was first published in March 2018., , , Nutrition, Serving:, 1, Slice, |, Calories:, 640, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 54.9, g, |, Protein:, 9.3, g, |, Fat:, 46.9, g, |, Saturated Fat:, 22.1, g, |, Sodium:, 112, mg, |, Fiber:, 6.7, g, |, Sugar:, 37.3, g, , , , , , DID YOU MAKE THIS RECIPE?, Rate it & leave your feedback in the comments section below, or tag, @lovingitvegan, on Instagram and hashtag, #lovingitvegan, , Get Your Copy!

pan | eggless chocolate lava cake in appe pan, with step by step photo and video recipe. cake recipes are one of the popular dessert snack recipes for most young audiences. but the assumption is, the fancy choco lava cake can also be made with an easily available cooking base like appe pan and this recipe show a mini lava cake recipe., , i have posted so many fancy cake recipes which are with and without oven and cooker based recipes. yet i get a lot of request asking to show some basic cake recipes using easily available cooking utensils at home. last time i showed you how to use a steamer to bake a cake and also showed you a deep frying pan to bake a chocolate cake. but this recipe is unique and i have used an appe pan to produce mini lava cake. unlike the traditional lava cake, i feel using appe pan to prepare lava cake is a much easier and simpler option. i still remember the last time when i was preparing the lava cake in the oven, it hardly had lava inside. it was getting mixed into the batter and was struggling to get the chocolate ooze. but this recipe is quick, easy, instant and can be attempted by wannabe chefs., , , furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the, mini choco lava cake in appam pan, . firstly, i would heavily recommend using a non-stick appe pan and avoid using the cast iron pan to prepare this mini lava cake. cast iron may cause the cake to stick to the base and may not easily come out with a smooth surface. secondly, i would recommend using cooking or baking chocolate rather than consumable or commercial chocolate. cooking chocolates easily melts and do not get mixed with cake batter and hence you can easily distinguish the difference. lastly, if you do not have the appe pan, you can use the same cake batter and steam it in idli, stand, . you may need to get deeper idli stand as you need space to fill the chocolate., , finally, i request you to check my other related, eggless cakes recipes collection, with this post of, mini choco lava cake in appam pan, . it mainly includes recipes like, oreo chocolate cake, , , mirror glaze cake, , , chocolate cupcake in katori, , , choco lava cup cake \u2013 parle-g

        "Vegan Coffee cake": "Ingredients: , , , Oat flour, \u2013 Use regular oat flour or gluten-free oat flour if you are a celiac. You can also make your own oat flour from rolled oats in a blender or electric coffee/spice grinder., , White rice flour, \u2013 Brown rice might work fine as well. You can most likely also use 1:1 gluten-free flour (or regular all-purpose flour if you\u2019re not gluten-free) instead of oat flour and rice flour. I haven\u2019t tried these combos, though., , Cornstarch, \u2013 Arrowroot flour or potato starch might be used instead of cornstarch., , Erythritol, \u2013 Use Erythritol for a refined sugar-free coffee cake. However, you can use regular sugar instead., , Applesauce, \u2013 You can probably also use mashed banana instead or pumpkin pur\u00e9e., , Vegetable oil, \u2013 I used coconut oil, but canola oil is fine too. If you want to make the vegan coffee cake oil-free, I would suggest increasing the amount of applesauce. The texture will be different, though. Oil or vegan butter is also needed for the crumble topping, however, you could try replacing it with vegan cream cheese or nut butter., , Dairy-free milk, \u2013 Any non-dairy milk is fine. Some examples are almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, coconut milk, cashew milk, etc., , Coconut sugar, \u2013 You could also use brown sugar for the cinnamon streusel topping., , Almond flour, \u2013 To make the recipe nut-free, simply use ground shredded unsweetened coconut., , Baking powder, baking soda, apple cider vinegar, \u2013 They will help the cake rise., , Cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt, \u2013 Used for flavor., , , are listed in the, printable recipe card below, !

The baking time can be a few minutes less or more, depending on your oven and the size of the pan.

        "Vegan Gingerbread Cake": "Ingredients: , , , , A bundt cake is a cake that is baked in a bundt pan. Bundt pans come in a variety but they are all ring-shaped, inspired by a classic European cake. If you don't have a bundt pan, you can also make this cake into a sheet cake or gingerbread loaf., Here is everything you need., Ingredient Notes, All-Purpose Flour -, For gluten-free options, you can use a 1:1 Gluten-Free Flour Baking Blend, (<<affiliate link)., You could also use up to 50% whole wheat flour without negatively affecting the taste and texture., Spices, - You will need a combination of ground cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves., Vegan Butter -, Look for a high-quality non-hydrogenated vegan butter. I recommend, Miyoko\u2019s, .

Add the molasses and applesauce and combine., Pro Tip:, Finish the batter by, into the batter in three batches, starting with the flour mixture.

Yet, as we know, over-mixing results in a gummy glutenous texture., , , Do I need to use a Bundt cake pan?, , No! If you don't have a bundt cake pan, you can bake this into two 9x5 (or similarly sized) loaf pans or make a sheet cake by filling a baking sheet \u00be of the way full.

I used gluten-free flour and added 1tsp of baking powder as well as I find that the gluten-free flour sometimes needs a bit of help. I used fresh cherries cut in half for the filling as I love baking with cherries and find that they become all moist and syrupy when you bake them. I will add more cherries next time and will definitely be baking them again ahead of Christmas., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Aimee, , says, , , December 05, 2021 at 3:26 pm, , , , I'm so pleased they worked out well for you, with the gluten-free flour!

I wasn't sure about the hot water and oil so I just poured it on the dry ingredient and it started bubbling so I was scared it would turn out bad; no, it was heavenly great! I made my own jam with frozen cherries and some sugar left it an hour or so until I got the right consistency. As for the frosting I simply bought the So Delicious cocowhip and it was perfect for 3 days.

        "Vegan Banofee pie cheesecake": "Ingredients: flavour and texture and this is spot on. It's a little softer than the original, but tastes fabulous., , , , , , , , , , , , , , How vegan cheesecake is made, , , , Cake Tin, , Use any size, a larger tin will make a thinner cheesecake and a smaller tin will make a deeper cheesecake. The standard size is 20 cm diameter, but I play about with the size. Use whatever you have in your cupboard. However to make life easier I say use a loose-bottom tin if you have one. You want to handle the cheesecake as little as possible., , , , Base, , For the base I used crushed Tesco Everyday Digestives which are accidentally vegan, but you could use McVities Hobnobs, Bourbon Biscuits or Oreos. The crushed biscuits are mixed with melted dairy free spread and pressed into the base of the cake tin and chilled., , , , Cheesecake Filling, , I leave a tin of full fat coconut milk in the fridge overnight, so the solids and water separate. Then I whisk the thick coconut solids and combine with the dairy free cream cheese, (which I have also whipped to loosen it), , vanilla paste, (you can use extract, but never use essence as it's horrible stuff), and sweeten.\u00a0The filling is spread onto the base and chilled. You could serve the cheesecake as it is or top it with my banoffee topping or any other topping you choose. The vanilla is a nice base for other flavours, such as fruit or chocolate., , , , Topping, , I have to hold my hands up and admit I didn't make the caramel. Life is just too short. I used shop-bought, coconut caramel, , (you could use caramel condensed milk if you are veggie), . Once the cheesecake was carefully removed from the tin,\u00a0 I spread the top of the cheesecake with the caramel and then topped with slices of banana and some grated dark chocolate., , , , , , , , , , , Yield:, 8-10, Author:, Jacqueline Meldrum, Print Recipe, Pin it, , , , Vegan Banoffee Pie Cheesecake Recipe, , A luxurious no-bake vegan cheesecake with the flavours of banoffee pie. No need to soak nuts for this cheesecake as it's made the traditional way but with dairy-free cream cheese and whipped coconut. This cheesecake can be used as a base for lots of different toppings from fruit puree and fresh fruit to chocolate., , , prep time: 30 MINS, cook time:, total time: 30 mins, , , , , , , , 100g dairy free spread, , , 200g vegan digestives (bourbons, hobnobs or oreos), , 400g tin full fat coocnut milk, left in the fridge overnight to thicken, , 4 tbsp caster sugar, , 2 tsp vanilla bean paste (or extract), , 400g vegan cream cheese, , 2 tbsp coconut water, if the mixture is too thick, , 6-8 tbsp coconut caramel (optional), , 2 small bananas, sliced, , 1 square dark chocolate, grated, , , , ,  Instructions: , , , , Line a loose-bottom cake tin with greaseproof paper or coat with baking spray., , Melt the dairy free spread.\u00a0 While this is melting, crush the biscuits and mix together the melted spread with the biscuit crumbs. Press into the base of the cake tin and pop in the fridge to chill., , Take the tin of coconut milk out of the fridge, turn it upside down and open it. Pour the coconut water into a glass, (you can use this for smoothies), and whisk the thick coconut cream with the sugar and vanilla paste until thick. If it is too thick, add a little coconut milk., , Beat the cream cheese until soft, then whip into the whipped coconut cream and spread over the cheesecake base then return to the fridge until you are ready to serve it., , When you are ready to serve, loosen the edge with a knife dipped in hot water, then carefully remove from the tin., , Top with some caramel (optional), sliced banana and grated chocolate, then serve., , Enjoy!, , , , , Created using, The Recipes Generator, , , , , , , If you liked this recipe try my, Vegan No-Bake Oreo and Caramel Cheesecake, .\u00a0 For more Christmas recipe ideas (both veggie and vegan), check out my, Veggie Christmas Page, ., , , , Today's Christmas Gift Idea, , , , , Squirrel Storage Jar, - Forma \u00a320, , , Squirrel Nut Tray, - Forma \u00a324, , , , , And a rather special hamper, , , , , , , , , This specially curated hamper manages to be entirely indulgent whilst still being suitable for vegans.

I learned that from someone on YouTube and it completely gets rid of the dome 99% of the time and the other 1% it\u2019s still significantly better. My suggestion would be to oil the cooling rack tho if your cake is really tender so it doesn\u2019t stick and pull off part of the top or what I do and take the parchment round that was on the bottom of the cake and place it in between the cake and the cooking rack so you don\u2019t get marks. when you try and remove it.

        "Vegan German Chocolate cake": "Ingredients: , , A few tips on how to make this vegan chocolate cake, , Use a spatula to spread the chocolate cake batter in the bottom of the cake pans., Use four 6\u2033 cake pans, or two 8\u2033 cake pans. Be mindful the 8\u2033 cake will be shorter., Let the cakes cool down all the way, then place them in the fridge until completely cold, before proceeding with assembling the cake., The cakes will be very moist, rich, and delicious, handle them with care. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that they are cold from the fridge., , , The filling used in the Vegan German Chocolate Cake is one of the simplest, easiest things you\u2019ll ever make., , , Coconut butter, Cashew butter (or other nut butter), Shredded coconut, Maple syrup, , and let them cook for about 60 seconds, while stirring, in a medium-low heat, with a very gentle simmer., , That\u2019s it., , Then pour the coconut filling into a bowl. Let it cool down to room temperature., , Important! Don\u2019t place the filling in the fridge, or it will be impossible to spread it on the cakes. Use it at room temperature., , , After the cake has chilled in the fridge, all you gotta do is pour the ganache over it., , How to achieve the perfect ganache consistency, , It\u2019s always best to use the ganache after making it, and letting it cool down to room temperature., , If you have to place the ganache in the fridge, then bringing it back to room temperature is certainly possible as well., , You can also play with the microwave and fridge in order to try to obtain the perfect ganache consistency., , , Anyway, , 1x, 2x, 3x, Vegan Chocolate Cake, 2, , tablespoons, , flax seeds, 5, , tablespoons, , warm water, 2, , cups, , almond flour, 1/3, , cup, , arrowroot flour, 1 1/2, , cup, , coconut sugar, 1/2, , teaspoon, , baking powder, 1/4, , teaspoon, , baking soda, 1/4, , teaspoon, , fine sea salt, 1/2, , cup, , unsweetened cocoa powder, 1/4, , cup, , almond milk or any other nut milk, 1/3, , cup, , avocado oil, 1/4, , cup, , apple sauce, 1, , teaspoon, , vanilla extract, Coconut Filling, 1/3, , cup, , maple syrup, 1/2, , cup, , coconut butter, 3, , tablespoons, , cashew butter*, 1/2, , cup, , shredded coconut, Vegan Ganache, 1/3, , cup, , coconut cream 3 oz, , 85 grams, 1/2, , cup, , chocolate chips 3.1 oz, , 90 grams, , Sift together the almond flour, coconut sugar, arrowroot flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder in a bowl. Set aside., Mix milk, avocado oil, apple sauce, vanilla, Divide batter into the 4 pans., Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pans in the oven to ensure even baking., Touch the cake with your finger, if it springs back it\u2019s done. If it forms a dimple, means your cake needs to be baked longer. Keep checking so you don\u2019t let it overbake., Remove cakes from the oven and let them cool for 15 minutes in the pan. Turn cakes onto a cooling rack. Let them cool completely, wrap and refrigerate them. It will make a difference to frost them while they are cold, because they will be sturdier, since this is a very moist and scrumptious cake., Coconut Filling, Let mixture gently cook for about 1 minute., Remove to a bowl. Let it cool to room temperature., Vegan Ganache, Heat the coconut cream until it almost reaches a boil., Pour over chocolate chips. Wait a couple of minutes., Stir mixture with a spatula gently, until all chocolate has melted., If chocolate doesn\u2019t melt, and you still see lumps, you want to place your ganache bowl in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time, stirring in between, until the chocolate has melted entirely., Set aside to cool to room temperature., To assemble, Place a slice of cake on a cake plate, or cake board., Spread some of the coconut filling in the middle. Place another cake on top., Keep doing this to all layers., Let it chill in the fridge until cold., Now it\u2019s time to pour the ganache on top. You want the ganache to be at the perfect consistency, it can\u2019t be too runny, and it can\u2019t be too stiff. If your ganache is too runny, place it in the fridge for a few minutes and stir, repeating this until you achieve the desired consistency., Alternatively, if ganache is too stiff or hardened, you want to place it in the microwave for 3 second intervals, stirring in between, until you achieve the desired consistency., Test by dropping a small droplet on the side of the cake and watch how the drip flows, if it\u2019s reaching the bottom of the cake too fast, it means it might be too runny, and if it doesn\u2019t run down the cake, means it might be too stiff., You want the drip to stop in the middle of the cake, that\u2019s when you know your ganache is at the perfect consistency., Let cake chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours before slicing., Decorate with the peanut butter truffles., Storage, This cake will store nicely in the fridge or freezer., Simply make sure to package it really well if you plan on freezing it, and only do it up to 1 month., It will keep nicely in the fridge for up to 5 days., , , Notes, *You can use other nut butter other than cashew to make the coconut filling. I find the cashew butter to have a mild taste, and color, and provide the best results, but any other nut butter could also work., , *I used these, vegan brigadeiros, to decorate the top of the cake, , Nutrition, Calories:, 500, kcal, , , , , Keyword, cake, chocolate, coconut, , , , , Tried this recipe?, Let us know, how it was!, , , , 5360, , shares, , , , , , , Share, , , , , Tweet, , , , , Pin, , , , , , , Post navigation, , Previous, , Previous, Marble Vegan Tea Cakes, Next, Continue, , Vegan Raspberry Bars, , , , , , Similar Posts, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Vegan Almond Tahini Truffles, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Fall Macarons, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter Frosting, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Pumpkin Cheesecake Macarons (plus video), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Strawberry Mint Macarons, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Vegan Caramel Cupcakes, , , , , , , , , , , , , , 19 Comments, , , , , , , , Cegaso, , says:, , , , February 27, 2019 at 1:54 pm, , , , , Ma que bolo maravilhoso!!!!!!!

I totally forgot to write that in. I actually used some of the ganache for the drip., I saved some ganache from the drip, and then whipped it with my mixer. And becomes lighter in color, and easy to pipe. If you do this, just make sure that the ganache is at room temperature when you whip it. If it\u2019s too warm it won\u2019t whip, and if it\u2019s too cold, it will form lumps, and separate., Thank you so much!!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , , Ashley, , says:, , , , March 7, 2019 at 1:15 am, , , , , Beautiful!

It separated., If I had to give a shot to another ingredient in place of the coconut butter would probably be some type of nut butter, maybe use extra cashew butter. I dont know how the texture of the filling would turn out though, since the coconut butter and the cashew butter have different textures.

And then give it a good stir. Grab a small amount on the end of a teaspoon. Hold it on the edge of the top of the cake, and let one small drop of ganache drip down the side of the cake., , Watch how it behaves. If the the drop reaches the bottom of the cake quickly, your ganache is too runny. If the drop won\u2019t move, or go below the middle line of the cake, your ganache is too hard., , What you are looking for: a drop that travels all the way down to the middle of the cake or a little below, in a slow controlled pace., , If the ganache is too runny, you might want to place it in the fridge for a few minutes, give it a stir, and test. And keep putting it in the fridge and testing every few minutes., , If the ganache is too hard, you might want to put it in the microwave for a few seconds, like 4 seconds. And then give it a good stir, and test it again. Keep doing this until you find the desired consistency. However, don\u2019t go above just a few seconds, because you don\u2019t want to overheat the ganache., , , If you like this Vegan German Chocolate Cake, you might want to check out some more of my, Vegan Recipes, ., , Want more Vegan Cakes?, , How about:, , Coconut Vegan Cake, Raspberry Vegan Cake, Chocolate Peanut Butter Vegan Cake, , And if you want to see any vegan dessert recommendations, here are some, but don\u2019t forget to browse the whole Vegan section, as I have a lot of stuff there., , Chocolate Chip Cookie Vegan Pie, Pecan Brownie Vegan Pie, Brownies with Caramel Sauce, , , I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s recipe.

        "Vegan Triple Chocolate Cake": "Ingredients: , One is the vegan buttermilk.\u00a0 For starters, your milk should be room temperature.\u00a0 If not, put it in the microwave for a few seconds until it\u2019s room temp or even slightly warm.\u00a0 Then, time to make the vegan buttermilk!\u00a0 Haven\u2019t done this before?\u00a0 It\u2019s so easy!\u00a0 Mix non-dairy milk with some apple cider vinegar, white vinegar, or lemon juice, and let it sit for a few minutes to curdle.\u00a0 This gives it a thicker texture and keeps the end result extra moist and well formed., , Next wet ingredient prep is the coconut oil, which will be melted for this recipe.\u00a0 So melt that and set aside. Remember to measure out the cup when it is MELTED, and not before. And remember to use, liquid measuring cups, !!, , In a large bowl, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking powder, melted coconut oil, applesauce, HOT or boiling filtered water, and vanilla extract.\u00a0 Don\u2019t ignore the part where I say the water should be hot!\u00a0 This is important in helping make the cake ultra-rich and moist!, , Mix and bake.., , Mix until fully combined, then pour evenly into parchment lined & greased cake tins.\u00a0 I like to weigh each one with my handy dandy, kitchen scale, to make sure they\u2019re all roughly the same weight, that way they all look uniform and pretty at the end., , Bake at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes.\u00a0 That\u2019s the exact right time for my oven, so if you know yours runs hot, perhaps start to check it with a toothpick at 22/23 minutes, and if it takes a bit longer perhaps go up to 27/28 minutes.\u00a0 As soon as a toothpick emerges with just crumbs, no batter, get those babies out of there!, , , , , , , , , , Let them cool in the pan for about 15 or so minutes, then flip them out onto cooling racks.\u00a0 Let them come to room temperature this way, or put in the fridge to chill.\u00a0 Personally I find cakes MUCH easier to frost when they are cold.\u00a0 And you likely need more time for your ganache to keep cooling, so no rush anyway., , One last note on the cake layers \u2013 I like to level these so they are not domed at all.\u00a0 They really don\u2019t dome very much while baking, but it\u2019s my personal preference to keep layers as flat as possible!, , The frosting!, , Okay last step before building your triple chocolate cake masterpiece \u2013 the frosting!\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about this frosting for a minute.\u00a0 The incredibly deep dark rich colored frosting you see in these photos is made using Dutch cocoa powder, not regular cocoa powder.\u00a0 This is completely your choice.\u00a0 I like the dark chocolate flavor that comes with Dutch cocoa powder, but you can use whichever you prefer or have laying around.\u00a0 Also if you are already feeling like this may be a chocolate overload, see a few paragraphs below for other frosting options., , To make the frosting, I use a simple, hand mixer, , but if you have a fancier mixer then yay you!\u00a0 I start by mixing just the vegan butter on its own until it\u2019s fluffy, combining fully each time before adding more., , I use exactly the amounts I have listed below, but you may need to adjust a little bit based on the moisture content of your butter.\u00a0 If the frosting is too stiff, add a little bit more milk.\u00a0 If it\u2019s too moist, add a little bit more powdered sugar until it\u2019s just right., , Putting it together!, , We\u2019re almost at triple chocolate cake time \u2013 now we build it!\u00a0 This is pretty straightforward \u2013 one layer, chocolate ganache, another layer, chocolate ganache, then the frosting all around the top and sides.\u00a0 The only thing I will say is the ganache is loose, it doesn\u2019t set and get hard in the same way frosting does when you are frosting a cake.\u00a0 I like to pop the cake in the fridge for a few minutes before adding the frosting, that way the ganache sets enough so that if you push down on the cake while frosting it, it won\u2019t squish out the sides.\u00a0 And same goes for when you are cutting pieces \u2013 if it\u2019s set for a few minutes, it should stay put., , , If you\u2019ve left it in the fridge for a while before serving, or if you\u2019ve stored it there and are coming back for seconds the next day and want the ganache to be melty again, put your piece in the microwave for about 15 seconds.\u00a0 I find this to be the right amount of time to unset the ganache without turning it all into mush., , FINAL THING!\u00a0 As promised, if you want to replace the frosting with a non-chocolate option, personally I\u2019d recommend one of these three options:, , -Salted Caramel Frosting!\u00a0 Note if you are doing this one it takes some prep time, so check it out now, don\u2019t wait til the end of the cake making process!\u00a0 Find it in, this chocolate cake recipe, , -Cream Cheese Frosting!\u00a0 Cream cheese + chocolate is criminally underrated.\u00a0 Find it in, this red velvet cake recipe, , -Vanilla Buttercream Frosting!\u00a0 Can\u2019t hate on a classic.\u00a0 Find it in, this vanilla cupcake recipe, , , Storage:, , This triple chocolate cake can be kept at room temperature for a couple of days, or in the fridge for closer to a week.\u00a0 If you are keeping it in the fridge, I\u2019d recommend warming up each piece for about 15 seconds in the microwave before eating if you want the ganache to be pudding-like again.\u00a0 You can also freeze for a few months., , Pro Tips & Tools:, , this\u00a0set, ., Need any other tools I\u2019ve used here? For the cake itself I use these, cake tins, , these, parchment liners, , and this, kitchen scale, to make sure each layer is the same size. For the frosting, I use this simple, hand mixer, . And to frost the cake you can use a simple, offset spatula, , or spring for this, whole set, of cake stuff., , , Vegan chocolate bars \u2013 two good 4-ounce chocolate bars for the ganache.\u00a0 I love these, 56% Cacao Baker\u2019s Bars, Coconut cream \u2013 also for the ganache., This brand, , is my go-to, but any will work.\u00a0 Make sure not to shake it before opening!, 8oz, , chopped vegan chocolate, 8oz, , coconut cream \u2013 JUST the thicker part that rises to the top of the can!, 3, , cups, , gluten free flour, , can sub all-purpose if desired.

Add the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl and mix together.\u00a0 Then add in the vegan buttermilk, melted coconut oil, applesauce, HOT or boiling water, and vanilla extract, then fully mix using a large spoon or spatula until it is just combined., Pour the batter evenly into the cake tins \u2013 I like to weigh each one to make sure the layers will come out the same size.\u00a0 Put into the oven for about 25 minutes, testing for doneness by sticking a toothpick into the center of the cakes and making sure it comes out with just crumbs and not wet batter.\u00a0 Remove the cakes from the oven and let cool in the pans for about 15-20 minutes before moving to cooling racks.\u00a0 I like to then put the layers directly into the fridge to cool completely, as I find it\u2019s easier to frost the cake when it is cold., Chocolate Buttercream Frosting, : the final step once you are just a few minutes away from putting your cake together is making the frosting.\u00a0 Take the vegan butter directly from the fridge so it is cold and solid, and put into a large mixing bowl.\u00a0 Use either a hand mixer or a fancier mixer to beat the butter until it is soft and fluffy, then add in the cocoa powder and the powdered sugar a little bit at a time, + the salt",
        "Secretly Vegan Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake": "Ingredients: , What you\u2019ll need for this vegan chocolate cake part:, , , Flour, : you can use gluten free or all purpose flour here. Just make sure that it\u2019s sifted!, , Cocoa powder:, While, cacao powder is loaded with polyphenols, (, antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and improve blood flow, ), cocoa powder still has incredible benefits, and is actually, much better, for baking. If you want tall vegan cakes, please use all natural cocoa powder. The acidity found in natural cocoa powder (I purchase the one in the purple tin) will react with the baking soda, causing our cakes to rise., , Granulated sugar and brown sugar sugar, , Leavening agents:, just baking powder and baking soda here!, , Vegan buttermilk:, , you can use any dairy-free milk, such as, oat milk, , coconut, or almond. The apple cider vinegar helps to curdle the milk to be much like a buttermilk (only vegan!). This will give the cake a bit of a lift and extra moisture. I\u2019ve also experimented with this cake using Forager Project\u2019s drinkable cashew milk yogurt; it acts much like a store bought vegan buttermilk!, , Applesauce:, the, vegan egg replacement, (and added moisture!). You can also swap in dairy free yogurt., , Vegan peanut butter frosting:, This peanut butter buttercream is absolutely incredible! So creamy and lush. I like to use vegan unsalted butter, and use creamy peanut butter (unsalted). Make sure to just add a pinch of sea salt to help bring the flavor together! Then you\u2019ll also use powdered sugar (or powdered coconut sugar) and a little dairy free milk. You can also add in a teaspoon vanilla extract here if you\u2019d like., , Vegan ganache & vegan peanut butter cups:, While this cake tastes like a Reese\u2019s cup, we\u2019re not actually using any reese\u2019s peanut butter cups in or on top of the cake! If you\u2019d like to decorate the cake with peanut butter cups, you can use store bought (I like Unreal Chocolate best) or make your own., , , , , Overview: How to make a decadent vegan chocolate peanut butter cake:, , , this is very important if you want a super moist and tender vegan cake while not getting that claggy texture., , Don\u2019t over mix the batter!, Mix the batter until it\u2019s just combined. This will prevent the gluten from activating and creating a gummy texture., , , Tips for making vegan buttercream frosting, , , Make sure the vegan butter is room temperature:, much like regular buttercream frosting, to make a vegan buttercream frosting, the vegan butter needs to be entirely room temperature. You can use any vegan butter here: I like Miyoko\u2019s or Forager Project, but it also works well with Earth Balance. I notice more of a soy taste to Earth Balance though., , Only make the buttercream when you\u2019re ready to frost!, And on that note, make sure that the cakes are entirely cool before beginning. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up with your beautiful vegan chocolate cakelayers on the ground!, , Use the same bowl for the vegan peanut butter buttercream as you will with the vegan chocolate buttercream:, this saves bowls, time, and gives the chocolate buttercream more of a peanut butter taste!, , , , , How to store leftover cake, , If you have any leftovers of this vegan chocolate peanut butter cake (hey, it can happen from time to time!), I recommend storing the cake covered at room temperature for up to 2 days., , However, you can also slice the cake, cover it, and store it in an airtight container or cake container in the fridge for up to 5 days., , , , You\u2019re just going to absolutely love vegan chocolate peanut butter cake recipe!

I really wanted it to be delicious, but I used the measurements in the recipe and there didn\u2019t seem to be enough liquid in the cake batter, so I had to add loads more milk until it had a cake batter consistency. I also found the apple sauce gave the batter a gluey consistency, I dont know if applesauce in the UK is different to US applesauce, but I ended up with a chocolate sponge with apple chunks in, in hindsight I should have blended the applesauce before adding it or used a different egg replacer., , , , , , , , thebananadiaries, \u2014, March 10, 2021 @ 9:34 am, , Reply, , , Oh my goodness, I\u2019m so sorry!! It definitely sounds like the applesauce is different in the UK- there should be NO chunks of apple whatsoever in the applesauce. I\u2019m so sorry to hear this! It also sounds like there might have been too much flour- did you happen to scoop the flour or spoon and level? Too much flour will yield a gummy texture.

This cake looks amazing! I was just wondering what measurement of apple cider vinegar do you add to the dairy free milk to make the vegan buttermilk for the batter? Also you mention using the vegan buttermilk, but then in the recipe card it just says dairy free milk with 2tsp of lemon juice?, , , , , , , thebananadiaries, \u2014, March 14, 2021 @ 7:04 pm, , Reply, , , Hi Marie! I\u2019m so sorry for that confusion! The lemon juice and apple cider vinegar are interchangeable- either works for creating the buttermilk! Some people prefer lemon, and you won\u2019t taste it in the cake. When you mix the dairy free milk together the acid, then I just refer to it as the vegan buttermilk!

I made this for my husband\u2019s birthday because he wanted a chocolate peanut butter cake. We are vegan and gluten free, so I used King Arthur\u2019s 1-1 gluten free flour. I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of almond milk since the cake batter was initially too thick and it only needed 25mins in the oven, I was glad I checked it.  It got more compliments from other family members as well. The cake tasted moist and the subtle espresso flavor balanced the chocolate and the sweetness of the buttercream filling.

The batter before adding the water is thick but not overly thick once you add the hot water it makes a silky very pourable batter so do not add more milk or you will end up with a soupy mess . I didn\u2019t care for the peanut butter icing because I guess I don\u2019t like peanut butter this much, I ended up adding chocolate to it to make it a chocolate peanut butter icing . I added strawberry jam in one layer if you can make it yourself so it\u2019s not too sweet and thick it was a very nice complement to this cake .

        "Vegan Peanut Butter Cake": "Ingredients: , , I was inspired to make this cake from a little treat I used to get at a local coffee shop. They only had a few vegan options, and one of them was this little peanut butter snack cake. It actually didn\u2019t have frosting at all, but instead was topped with mini chocolate chips., , I decided to go all out and top my cake with peanut butter frosting, and the results are incredible!, , Peanut butter desserts can be rather dry, but this cake is very moist and tender. The texture of peanut butter cake is different than other cakes; it\u2019s not exactly light and fluffy, but once you take a bite you will be hooked!, , If you love peanut butter desserts, make sure to check out any of these recipes:, Peanut Butter Balls, , , Peanut Butter Chocolate Bars, , , Peanut Butter Cups, or, Peanut Butter Cookies, ., , How to make peanut butter cake, , (This is simply an overview with photos, see the recipe card below for the full recipe.), , Prepare your vegan \u201cbuttermilk\u201d by measuring the soy milk and adding the apple cider vinegar. Give a little stir and set aside. Then, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a 9\u00d713 inch pan (or 10\u00d715 for a sheet cake)., , , In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the peanut butter, sugar and oil until well combined and smooth, scraping the sides as needed., , Alternate adding the flour mixture and vegan buttermilk, in about 3 parts, until combined., , This cake batter will be thick and not like other cake batters, but that is correct so don\u2019t worry!, , Transfer the batter to the cake pan/dish and spread out evenly. Since it won\u2019t pour, you will need to really spread it to all the corners., , , , Bake for 28-32 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean or with just a few crumbs. Let cool completely before frosting., , Peanut butter frosting, , This frosting is so addicting, you won\u2019t be able to get enough!, , To make it, simply beat the peanut butter and vegan butter together until smooth and creamy, then add the powdered sugar, plant milk and vanilla. Beat for a few minutes until fluffy and smooth. If it\u2019s too thick, add a bit more milk. If it\u2019s too runny, add a little powdered sugar., , You may not use all of the frosting, so save the rest for another day. It freezes well. This stuff is totally pipe-able and would also be amazing on, cupcakes, or, chocolate cake, !, , , Tips & Substitutions, , , Milk, \u2013 I used soy milk, but another non-dairy milk will work just fine, like almond, cashew or oat milk., , Gluten free, \u2013 Try substituting a gluten free mix., , Peanut butter, \u2013 Make sure to use non-natural creamy peanut butter (like JIF). Natural possibly could work, but some brands are super oily while others are thick and dry, so for best results, just use the regular peanut butter., , Oil, \u2013 I used canola oil, but you can use another oil, like vegetable, avocado or possibly even melted coconut oil, though I haven\u2019t tried it. If you need the cake to be oil free, you could try subbing applesauce., , Don\u2019t over mix the cake batter, , but only mix until combined. This will help the cake be fluffy., , Sheet cake, \u2013 For a sheet cake, make it in a 10\u00d715 inch pan, but only bake it for 15-18 minutes., , , How to store the cake, , Store the cake at room temperature, there is no need to refrigerate it. Simply cover once cut so it doesn\u2019t dry out too quickly. It does freeze well, either in individual slices or whole., , , More vegan cakes to love, , , 1 Bowl Vegan Coconut Cake, , Vegan Vanilla Cake, , Vegan Lemon Cake, , Vegan Funfetti Cake, , Chocolate Sheet Cake, , , , , 4.70, stars (, 10, ratings), , Peanut Butter Cake, , , Prep:, 20, minutes, , mins, Cook:, 30, minutes, , mins, Total:, 50, minutes, , mins, Servings:, 16, , servings, , , , Print, , Pin, , Comment, , Save, Saved, , , US Customary, Metric, , 1x, 2x, 3x, Cake, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , soy milk*, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , apple cider vinegar, \u25a2, 2, , cups, , all purpose flour, \u25a2, 1, , tablespoon, , baking powder, \u25a2, 1/4, , teaspoon, , salt, \u25a2, 3/4, , cup, , creamy peanut butter, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , granulated sugar, \u25a2, 3/4, , cup, , vegetable oil*, Peanut Butter Frosting, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , creamy peanut butter, \u25a2, 3/4, , cup, , vegan butter, slightly softened, \u25a2, 3, , cups, , powdered sugar, \u25a2, 1, , teaspoon, , pure vanilla extract, \u25a2, 4-6, , tablespoons, , soy milk, more as needed, \u25a2, tiny pinch of salt, optional, , In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.

The cake batter is thicker than most, and won't really pour like other cake batter., Transfer to the prepared pan and spread out evenly. Bake for 28-32 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean in the middle. For a sheet cake (10x15 inch pan), it will only need 15-18 minutes in the oven., Let the cake cool completely, then frost generously with peanut butter frosting and serve. Sprinkle with mini chocolate chips, if desired., For the frosting, Using either a handheld or stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the peanut butter and vegan butter on medium speed until smooth and creamy., Add the powdered sugar, 4 tablespoons of soy milk, vanilla and optional salt. Beat on low speed at first, then gradually increase to high and beat for 2 minutes until very fluffy., If it seems too thick, add more milk, a few tablespoons at a time.

I baked mine in a 10\u201d round cake pan for 28 minutes at 350F and it came out perfectly. Used canola oil and non-natural creamy PB and the final product was not too oily.

I didn\u2019t read your comments about it until after I baked the cake, but it really works, no need to fear., I will try to replace oil with applesauce next time, though, I do feel it was a little bit on the oily side.

For anyone interested I used liners, sprayed them, filled the batter nearly to the top, and baked for 23 minutes. I then let them set for about 10-15 minutes before I took them out of the pan and let them rest on a cooling rack. They looked more like muffins in that they had an almost crust-like top but were soft and moist in the middle. They were perfect in my opinion, and the frosting is what put it over the top.

Thank you for sharing such detailed recipes and notes., , Do you think this peanut butter cake would work well as a layer cake?

Peanut butter cake does have a different texture than most cakes though, it\u2019s very moist and a little sticky for sure, in a wonderful way. Very unique.

Transfer the cakes to a wire cooling rack to cool completely before adding filling or frosting., While the cakes are baking, , prepare your coconut pecan filling., Mix the cornstarch into the cold coconut milk and whisk so that it's well mixed in. Then add the vegan butter to a saucepan and let it melt before you add the brown sugar and coconut milk/cornstarch mix. Stir constantly until the mixture boils and starts to thicken, then remove it from the heat and add in the vanilla, coconut flakes and chopped pecans. Set aside to cool completely before using., Prepare your chocolate buttercream frosting., Add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, vegan butter, 3 Tbsp of coconut milk and vanilla extract to the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Start off at slow speed, gradually increasing speed until it's very thick and smooth. If needed, add in extra coconut milk a tiny bit at a time to get to the ideal consistency., When the cakes are completely cool and your coconut/pecan filling is completely cold, then you can finalize your cake. Add all the coconut/pecan filling to the middle layer and then all the chocolate buttercream to the top. If you want to frost the sides as well you can do that, there is enough frosting to allow for this., Decorate the cake with coconut flakes, chopped pecans and vegan chocolate chips (optional)., , , Notes,  Instructions: , Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Spray two 8 inch cake pans with non-stick spray and line the bottoms with circles of parchment paper. Set aside., Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a mixing bowl and then add the sugar, baking soda and salt and mix together., Prepare your flax egg by adding 1 and \u00bd Tbsp ground flaxseed meal to a bowl and then adding in 4 and \u00bd Tbsp hot water (this equals 1 and \u00bd flax eggs). Leave it to sit for a minute and become gloopy., Add in the soy milk, vanilla extract, oil, , Coconut Flakes or Shredded Coconut are basically the same thing, but shredded coconut pieces are generally smaller, but you can use either/or., , Pecans can be raw or roasted., , I used coconut milk in the frosting as I already had a can of coconut milk open for use in the coconut/pecan filling.

        "Vegan Chocolate Pear Cake": "Ingredients: or you had to poach the pears in advance., , , So I came up with this vegan chocolate pear cake recipe that is so simple, you can even make it when you are half asleep. Just like I did!, , The cake isn\u2019t super sweet like some, vegan cakes, , instead it has a dark richness which contrasts beautifully with the sweetness of the pears., , We affectionately named this a peekaboo pear cake, because of the cute way the pears peek out. We hope you like it!, , , \u2192 If you are looking for a cake without chocolate, try our, vegan pear cake, that is made with pear puree instead!, , , , Ingredient tips, , , Pears, - Choose fruits that are just ripe but not overly soft for best results. Medium sized pears work well. Select three similar sized pears that fit well together in a loaf tin., , It\u2019s alright if they touch each other, that way every slice has pear in. The cake in the photos has peeled pears, but sometimes if we\u2019re in a hurry, or have organic pears, we skip peeling them!, , , Cocoa powder, - We\u2019re using European cocoa powder that is \u2018dutched\u2019 or alkalised, which means it is treated to reduce its natural acidity and bitter taste., , Baking soda/bicarbonate of soda and vinegar, - These act together to help the cake to rise. Instead of cider vinegar, you can use other types of vinegar such as wine vinegar, just don\u2019t leave it out., , Instant coffee powder, - This enhances the dark chocolate flavour of the cake, without making it taste like coffee. If you don\u2019t have instant coffee, you could replace some of the hot water in the recipe with some brewed black coffee instead., , , Serving, , We love to have this cake as a teatime pick me up. It also goes down great at parties and events, as people are always intrigued by it\u2019s unusual appearance., , As the recipe uses whole pears, you\u2019ll want to just eat round the stalk and seeds., , We\u2019ve included an optional vegan chocolate sauce in the recipe which goes great with the cake, especially if you are serving it warm as a dessert., , Leave it to cool in the tin for a while after taking it out of the oven, to make it easier to slice., , Store leftovers in a cake tin for up to two days. Refrigerate in warm climates or for longer storage., , , More vegan chocolate recipes, , We hope you enjoy this vegan chocolate pear cake!

        "Vegan Triple Chocolate mousse cake": "Ingredients: you pour in about a cup and a half of boiling water. This helps \u201cbloom\u201d the cocoa powder and gives the cake this amazing rich dark chocolate taste. After your cakes are baked, let them cook completely before frosting. I recommend baking the cakes the night before and chilling overnight stacked between sheets of parchment to prevent sticking., , Make the chocolate mousse:, This chocolate mousse is the easiest dessert I\u2019ve been making for years. All you need is semisweet chocolate, silken tofu and a little sugar. Melt the chocolate and then pur\u00e9e everything in a high speed blender for a light and silky mousse. So good, so easy, and perfect for this vegan chocolate mousse cake. The key is letting it chill overnight, so I would recommend making the mousse while the cakes cool then chilling both overnight so everything\u2019s ready to go in the morning., , Make the chocolate ganache:, Ideally, it\u2019s the next day and you\u2019ve already made your cakes and mousse and they\u2019re chilling in the fridge. To make the ganache, start by melting the dairy free semisweet chocolate in a big mixing bowl along with your vegan butter and plant based milk of choice. I like doing this in the microwave, whisk only one cup of powdered sugar in and place the bowl in the refrigerator to thicken. This will take about an hour. Once the mixture is slow to move when the bowl is tilted, you can go ahead and whip it up like a normal frosting, adding more powdered sugar a cocoa powder for extra richness., , Assemble:, Once both your cakes and mousse is chilled and your frosting is made, it\u2019s time to assemble the cake. I started by leveling off my cakes using a serrated knife to get even layers. Place a the first layer on your cake board or plate followed by a layer of mousse. You don\u2019t want the mousse to escape out the sides, so don\u2019t spread it out too much. The pressure of the cake on top will do that for you. Repeat for another layer and then place in the fridge for 15 minutes before frosting. You want the ganache to be at room temperature or the chocolate will harden, making it difficult to spread. Use an offset spatula to spread a thick, even layer over the sides and top of the cake. Refrigerate until ready to serve and enjoy!, , , , Tips for making Vegan Chocolate Mousse Cake, , I highly recommend using Dutch processed cocoa powder. It makes the cakes so much richer and flavorful. Ive also found that it helps keeps them moist. My favorite brand is Droste, but any Dutch processed unsweetened cocoa powder will work. I would, however, stay away from Hershey\u2019s \u201cdark\u201d cocoa powder. I\u2019ve found that it won\u2019t yield the same rich, fudgy crumb., It\u2019s really important that the mousse chills overnight in the refrigerator. If not, your cakes will slide all over the place and it will be a mess. I recommend making the cakes and mousse the day before so both have enough time to chill. The next day, make the ganache and assemble the cake., Because there\u2019s a good amount of chocolate in the ganache, it will be much harder and difficult to spread if refrigerated. Thats why its best of you frost the cake with room temperature ganache. If you are having trouble spreading the ganache over the cake, either because it\u2019s sticking or it\u2019s too thick, just stir in a little more milk to thin it out. I recommend chilling there cake for at least half an hour before slicing for clean cuts., The cake will keep in the fridge for 5-6 days when stored in an air tight container., , Want more vegan chocolate desserts?

Divide among cake pans and bake for 20-35 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean., Allow to cool for 30 minutes in the pans and then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely before assembling. Ideally, chill overnight between sheets of parchment., For the mousse:, In the bowl of a food processor or hight speed blender add silken tofu and sugar. Blend until smooth., Use a double boiler to melt the chocolate then pour into the tofu mixture immediately blend to combine., Transfer to a sealable container and refridgerate for at least 6 hours, ideally overnight., For the ganache:, To a microwave safe bowl, add milk, chocolate and vegan butter. Microwave on 1 minute intervals, whisking in between until the butter and chocolate have melted and the mixture is smooth ans silky., Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer (or dont if using a hand mixer) and add 1 cup of powdered sugar. Beat with a whisk attactment then cover and refrigerate for 1 hour to firm up. You know its ready when you tilt the bowl and the mixture is slow to move., After chilling, beat in another 1 cup of powdered sugar and the cocoa poweder. If the ganache is too thin, add the remaining powdered sugar. If its too thick, add a tablespoon or too of milk until the desired consistency is reached., Assembly, Use a serrated knife to level off the cakes and discard (or eat) the scraps. Place the first layer on to your cake board or plate with the flattest side facing up. Add about a cup of mousse to the center of the cake and spread with a spatula. Repeat with the next layer, saving about a 1/2 cup of mousse for a thin crumb coat or to fill in any gaps. Place the cake in the refrigerator to chill for anout 15 minutes before frosting., Make sure the ganache is at room temperature before frosting. Use an offset spatula to spread the ganache evenly over the sides of the cake. If the ganache isnt sticking to the sides, its too thick. Add a tablepoon or two of milk unti its smooth and spreads easily. Top with chocolate shavings and refriderate until ready to serve., , , , Notes, , , * For a double layer cake, use 2 9\" cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.

I\u2019m blown away by how deliciously moist and light but fudgy it is!  I used half monk fruit and half sugar as we are trying to avoid simple carbs. Was a bit skeptical about the monk fruit but it wasn\u2019t noticeable in that proportion and the cake was plenty sweet without frosting. Will definitely make this again because there\u2019s no mixer to haul out and with that awesome trick of pouring hot water (coffee!) over the cocoa it was super simple to make. At some point I might use a mixture of almond & wheat flours (because I\u2019m curious) but I know for sure the recipe as written is perfect and am comfortable with it as is for the neighbor and anyone else in line for cake.

I use a similar recipe for depression cake and it also will fall in the middle if it\u2019s not 100% done when taken out of the over, which isn\u2019t ideal when doing a layer cake. However, when baked as a single layer cake served from the pan for everyday snacking, the slightly fallen middle is my favorite piece as it\u2019s SUPER moist and delicious. \ud83d\ude09 I love the idea of the hot water in this one and can\u2019t wait  to try it!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Kathryn C, , says, , , April 13, 2022 at 9:42 am, , , , I have made this for years. We call it (jokingly) Runny Cake, because I my mom usually made it on Sundays when we had guests after church, and she\u2019d be talking to them while mixing and invariably leave something out or put too much of something in. It didn\u2019t make a difference to us\u2014we ate it anyway, even if the middle was a bit runny.

        "Sugar Free Carrot Cake": "Ingredients: , As I wrote before, this healthy carrot cake contains mainly, oats, dates, and carrots, , , , Unsweetened shredded coconut:, It makes the cake moist and soft.

I may try a plant-based cream cheese frosting to complement the rest of the cake better. next time.

I definitely do, not, recommend coconut flour as it\u2019s very absorbent and dries out every dough., , If you can\u2019t eat nuts, then you could try making the cream layer with a (soy-based), vegan cream cheese, or use soaked, sunflower seeds, instead of cashews., , , How To Make Sugar-Free Carrot Cake, , Preparation, , , Soak the cashews for at least one hour in hot water. To speed up this process, you could also boil them for about 15 minutes until they are soft., However, if you have a powerful Vitamix, then soaking isn\u2019t really necessary., , Line a 7\u00d77-inch (18x18cm) square pan with parchment paper.

You can use a bigger pan, but the bars will be less thick., Make the dough, Pulse the walnuts and unsweetened shredded coconut in a food processor for about 10 seconds. Add the oat flour and spices and pulse again., Even though the video shows a blender, I definitely recommend using a food processor, since it works so much better., Next, , Sweetener:, You can use any granulated sugar of choice, for example, Erythritol, Monk Fruit, or even regular organic sugar., , Soak the dates:, It's important to use dates, that are very soft and moist.

        "Vegan German Chocolate Cake": "Ingredients: , For, , The Cake:, , Plain flour:, Just regular plain (all-purpose) flour. I don't recommend swapping it for wholemeal, it will make the cake too dense., , I haven't tried making this cake gluten-free, but I suspect that it would work ok with a gluten-free flour blend plus \u00bc tsp xanthan gum if the flour doesn\u2019t already contain it., , Cocoa powder:, I use dutch processed. For those of you in the UK, that is just regular cocoa powder., , Sugar:, I use caster sugar but granulated, light brown soft or coconut sugar will also work., , Baking powder and soda:, A mix of the two provides the best rise and light, soft texture., , Milk:, You can use any kind you like but it should ideally be unsweetened and soy milk is best as it has the highest protein content., , Oil:, Use a neutral flavoured oil such as sunflower or a mild olive oil. I wouldn't use coconut oil here unless you have no other option., , Vinegar:, This cake uses the reaction between the acid from the vinegar and the bicarbonate of soda to help it rise. I use either apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar. You can also use lemon juice instead., , Vanilla:, Extract is better than essence and you can also use vanilla bean paste., , Espresso powder:, This is optional, but adding a bit of instant espresso powder helps to deepen the chocolate flavour. It doesn't make the cake taste like coffee., , For The Filling:, , Coconut:, Dried shredded coconut is traditionally used but that can be hard to find in the UK. I used defrosted frozen shredded fresh coconut which I found in Morrisons, but unsweetened desiccated coconut or dried coconut flakes will also work., , Pecans:, Pecans are traditional but really any kind of nut will work. I like to decorate the cake with some extra nuts as well as using them in the filling., , Cornflour:, Usually the filling for German chocolate cake is thickened with egg yolks, but cornflour (cornstarch) makes a great substitute., , Coconut milk:, Traditionally, evaporated milk would be used, but full fat coconut milk works well in it's place. I have also seen evaporated coconut milk from Nature's Charm so you could also use that., , Butter:, I reccommend using a block vegan butter rather than the spreadable kind in a tub as it will help the filling to set better. I use Naturli vegan block or Flora plant butter., , Sugar:, Light brown soft sugar is best here as it adds a lovely caramel flavour. Dark brown soft will also work if you want a stronger flavour, and coconut sugar would also be fine., , For The Ganache:, , Dark chocolate:, I use 70% dark chocolate. Don't use anything with a higher cocoa percentage than that or it can make the ganache more likely to split., , Cream:, You can either use full fat coconut milk or a vegan double cream alternative such as Elmlea., , Syrup:, I add a touch of maple syrup to sweeten the ganache slightly. Golden syrup or agave would also work., , , How To Make Vegan German Chocolate Cake:, , , , Divide the batter evenly between two greased and lined 20 cm 8 in round cake tins. Bake for about half an hour until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean., , , To make the filling, place the cornflour in a bowl and gradually stir in the coconut milk., , , Melt the butter and sugar together gently in a pan then whisk in the cornflour mixture., , Bring the mixture up to a simmer and whisk constantly until it thickens., , , Stir in the toasted pecans and coconut, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. Set aside to cool., , , To make the ganache, finely chop the chocolate and place it in a heat-proof bowl., , Place the coconut milk and maple syrup in a pan and heat until it is almost simmering., , Pour the hot milk over the chopped chocolate and leave to sit for five minutes., , , Stir gently until melted and smooth. Set aside until it thickens enough to spread., , , To assemble the cake, trim the tops of the cake layers with a cake wire or a sharp serrated knife to level them., , Place one layer on a cake stand or plate and spread over all of the filling., , Place the other cake layer on top, upside-down. Spread over the ganache and decorate with chopped pecans if you like., , , Top Tips:, , All of my recipes are developed using grams, and as with all of my baking recipes I really do recommend using the metric measurements with a digital scale rather than the cup coversions. Cups are a wildly inaccurate measuring system and you will get far better, more consistent results using a scale, not to mention that it is also easier and less messy than cups!, , Make sure that you don't over-beat the batter as that can make the cake tough. Just mix it until no dry lumps remain. I recommend stirring it by hand with a balloon whisk., , Because it is important not to over-beat the batter, , I chose to just fill my cake with the coconut pecan caramel rather than topping it with it as well as I wanted it to be less sweet. If you want to top the cake with the filling as well as or instead of the ganache then you can easily double the filling recipe., , I used defrosted frozen shredded coconut, but dried shredded coconut, unsweetened desiccated coconut or coconut flakes will all also work., , Instead of the pecans you can use any kind of nut you like.

Do not let it come to the boil. Pour the hot milk over the chopped chocolate, making sure that it is fully covered, and leave to sit for five minutes., Stir gently until melted and smooth. Set aside until it thickens enough to spread. If you accidentally leave it for too long and it sets, you can gently re-warm it in short bursts in the microwave, stirring often., To assemble the cake, trim the tops of the cake layers with a cake wire or a sharp serrated knife to level them. Place one layer on a cake stand or plate and spread over all of the filling., Place the other cake layer on top, upside-down.

If it seems that the puree is very wet/watery, you could add a lower amount of puree at first, and then see what the batter looks like after you have added the flour. It should be quite a thick batter as you can see from the step by step pictures in the post. You could then add more puree if it seems too thick. Hope that helps and let us know how it goes!

        "Vanilla Vegan Gluten Free Cake": "Ingredients: , , incredibly simple and straight forward., Honestly, you might have everything on hand already! For this vegan gluten free cake, you\u2019ll need:, , Rolled oats:, please use certified gluten free rolled oats if you really need gluten free! Otherwise, you can use regular rolled oats, or you can also purchase store bought oat flour., Arrowroot starch:, this will help yield that cake like texture. You can also swap in cornstarch instead!, Sugar, : you can use granulated sugar or coconut sugar here. Please be sure to read the recipe card notes for how to use the refined sugar free option!, Dairy free milk:, you can use any dairy free milk here that you have on hand. You\u2019ll be combining it with apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar to create a dairy free buttermilk!, Applesauce:, this replaces eggs in traditional cake recipes. It\u2019s the perfect substitute as it doesn\u2019t leave any aftertaste and it really acts just like eggs in baking!, Vegan butter:, for nut free, I used Flora Plant Butter. Earth Balance is also a great option, and if you can have nuts, then Miyoko\u2019s works great as well!, Leavening agents:, this is your baking powder and baking soda., Vanilla:, I used vanilla powder in this recipe, and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. I\u2019ve linked the exact brand I used in the recipe card below. If you\u2019re making this cake for a special occasion, like a wedding or graduation, definitely use the vanilla powder. Otherwise, use vanilla extract! It will still taste amazing, I just think vanilla powder is extra special (it\u2019s ground up vanilla bean!)., , , How to make a vegan gluten free cake from scratch (using just oat flour), , You\u2019re going to just love how simple and easy this vegan gluten free cake is to make. And it honestly could be your favorite vanilla cake ever (it\u2019s not my family\u2019s, especially Jared\u2019s mom! She loves oat flour cakes!)., As with all of my recipes, and will create a more even bake., , , For the cake batter, you can use either a stand mixer or mix by hand. I used to bake my cakes ONLY by hand for years. In fact, I made an entire cookbook just baking by hand! So trust me, you can do this, don\u2019t feel bad if you don\u2019t have a stand mixer. I do now use a stand mixer, but you can still make an awesome cake by hand., , Once your cakes have been baked, it\u2019s important to allow your cake layers to, fully cool, before you even consider making the frosting! I sound super strict on this haha, but only because I\u2019ve been there where I rush through the process and end up with bulging frosting or cakes slipping onto the floor. It\u2019s so sad to see! Oat flour will also need more time to cool, as these cakes, while they taste light and tender, still are a bit denser than traditional cakes, even vegan ones., , Tips for this oat flour cake, , As with all of my cake recipes, I love to offer up some extra baking tips to ensure that this cake turns out just as amazing for you each time!! Below are a few of my top recommendations for baking this oat flour cake. I\u2019ve also included a few troubleshooting situations to help you during your baking process., , Do NOT make any substitutions unless otherwise noted, , This means PLEASE do not substitute out the oat flour for this cake. This vegan gluten free cake is designed, specifically, for oat flour, since my, vegan vanilla cake, whether homemade or store bought., , Any other substitutions I\u2019ve noted in the recipe card, i.e. using coconut sugar in place of granulated sugar, or using whichever dairy free milk you\u2019d like- please feel free to use those!, , , This is the biggest issue that I see when baking cakes. Not using, . This is so important, even for gluten free vegan cakes, as drastically different temperatures in the batter will cause, gumminess and denseness in the cake., , , Use homemade oat flour or store bought oat flour!, , Some oat flour cakes recommend just using homemade oat flour, but this vanilla vegan gluten free cake can use both! This is because we\u2019re using gram measurements, which is a much more accurate way to bake. 460 grams of oat flour either way is the same. I will note that, homemade oat flour, has a more rustic feel (which is what I used in the photos for this recipe). Personally, I LOVE it, and it definitely tastes \u201coat-ier.\u201d If you want a more classic vegan vanilla cake taste while still using oat flour, choose store bought! I recommend Arrowhead Mills for that., , You can make this cake as a three layer 6\u2033 cake or a two layer 8\u2033 cake, , Either will work here! You can even use the batter to make a vegan gluten free sheet cake as well. Please keep in mind that the baking temperatures will be slightly different. If you\u2019re doing a two layer 8\u2033 cake, there will be more batter in the cake pans, yielding a longer baking time., , Make sure your leavening agents (i.e. baking powder + baking soda) are still good to use!, , It\u2019s more common than not that when we go to bake a cake (or any baked good), our baking powder and/or baking soda are expired/not good anymore. This is what most often causes the cakes to not fully rise. If you\u2019ve had your baking powder/soda for more than 6 months, or it wasn\u2019t properly stored, definitely be sure to purchase some new before beginning. If you\u2019re unsure as to whether or not your leavening agents are still good to use, you can check out this great article on, how to check if your leavening agents still work!, , , How to prevent cake layers sticking to the pan, , To prepare my cake pans, I always line the bottoms with parchment paper and grease and flour the sides. I find that parchment paper on the bottom of the pan is the best and most guaranteed outcome of easily removing your cakes without them sticking to the pan. You can purchase parchment paper cake rounds already sliced, but I actually still just cut my own sizes every time I go to make a cake (which is a lot ha!)., , Cake troubleshooting, , Baking a vegan gluten free cake, we still run into the same problems that more classic bakers can run into. That\u2019s why I suggest checking out Chelsweet\u2019s, cake troubleshooting guide, . She has some amazing tips as to why we run into problems of gumminess, denseness, cakes sinking, etc., , , How to decorate a vegan cake, , My favorite part of the cake baking process is the decorating! Normally when I start a cake, I typically have an idea of how I want it to look in the end. For this oat flour cake, I made it during the spring, so I thought let\u2019s go with a floral design!, , My favorite cake decorating tools:, , Cake turntable (this is the, exact one I use, \u2013 it\u2019s only $10, and honestly you shouldn\u2019t be spending any more than that on a turntable!), Small and large, offset spatulas, Piping bags (these, reusable, ones are great!), Piping tips (I used a bunch of different, Wilton floral piping tips, to create the, roses, and flowers), Vegan food colors (I\u2019ll go over that in the next section!), , I have some awesome tips for cake decorating in my, vegan wedding cake, post (which I will definitely be using for my own wedding cake!

So for this cake, you can use a different vegan butter if you have it! I haven\u2019t tested the coconut oil option, as I wanted to keep it coconut free. I have used coconut oil with my regular vegan vanilla cake, and it works great, but I worry that coconut oil would create too dense of a texture for this particular cake.

For the applesauce, does it work the same to puree an actual apple rather than using cooked and processed applesauce?

I apologize for just responding to this! So you could actually use dairy free yogurt if you can have that (like a pure coconut yogurt would work!), or mashed banana! The only thing I worry about with making an apple puree is that you wouldn\u2019t be able to get the apple pureed enough (like you would a banana). You could in theory use it, but you really need to get it to the consistency of applesauce then!

The most important part is ensuring that you\u2019ve coated your bundt pan enough with oil and a light dusting of oat flour. This will help the cake come out of the pan once it has cooled.

I am so sorry you are having issues. I usually use plain white vinegar for this chocolate cake recipe. I have used apple cider vinegar before when I was out of white vinegar and had the exploding issue as well! I would try dialing back on the amount of vinegar and see if that helps. And I usually get between 13-15 cupcakes out of this recipe (regular sized cupcakes).

Instead of the fresh strawberries, she made it with strawberry jam and reduced the amount of sugar that was called for.  Everyone at her daughter\u2019s birthday party loved it.  So I thought I would try it using Bob Red Mill 1 to 1 Gluten-free flour for my husbands birthday.  This was a MISTAKE.  It was heavy and not at all a good texture.  I followed the recipe step by step reducing fresh strawberries (time consuming), but alas, I would not recommended this recipe be used with GF flour., , , Reply, , , , , , , , Sheryl, , says:, , , , January 7, 2025 at 1:25 pm, , , , , , , , Love these cupcakes!
