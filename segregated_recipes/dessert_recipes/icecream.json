I omitted the green color, and since I only had coconut milk on hand (no cream), I used two cans of coconut milk, discarding the thin liquid from one of the cans, and added a quarter cup of coconut oil for fat. I ended up using about 3/4 tsp of peppermint extract to get the taste right. The frozen texture is light and very smooth.

The best way to do this is to beat the ice cream mixture in your stand mixer before freezing. And then before it\u2019s frozen, bring it out a couple more times and beat it again. This will come closest to what you\u2019ll get from an ice cream machine. Alternatively you can just freeze it!

I got the idea for it from a BlendTec recipe for mint and chop ice cream, and it works pretty well for the green color. It\u2019s a little darker than with food coloring, but that certainly wouldn\u2019t be \u201cpuke green\u201d. Spinach also adds almost no extra flavor.

        "Vegan Chocolate icecream": "Ingredients: , , Do you own an ice cream maker? Okay, if I knew that homemade ice cream was so incredibly easy to make, I would\u2019ve started making it ages ago. I actually borrowed by mom\u2019s ice cream maker to make sure it\u2019s an appliance I, actually, need. J and I moved into our new apartment in Toronto early March (and back to Canada last September) and my new kitchen is already splitting at the seams with kitchen gadgets and appliances. After a couple weeks of ice cream making, I\u2019m convinced an ice cream maker is definitely worth the investment., , , I mean look at that silky, creamy, fluffy and superrr chocolatey Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream. Just heavenly., , One thing I never do in my, recipes, is skimp on the chocolate. Because it\u2019s good for you, my partner J is, Belgian, , and I\u2019m a, chocoholic, .\u00a0I used, cacao, powder in this Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream but a high-quality cocoa powder also works\u00a0great. Cacao powder is a bit more expensive than cocoa powder but it is slightly less refined and the chocolate flavor is so just oh-so-rich\u00a0and decadent. I love using it when I bake and it worked like magic in this homemade ice cream., , , snap a photo and tag me, #CearasKitchen, on, Instagram, ., , , Print, , , clock, , clock icon, cutlery, , cutlery icon, flag, , flag icon, folder, , folder icon, instagram, , instagram icon, pinterest, , pinterest icon, facebook, , facebook icon, print, , print icon, squares, , squares icon, heart, , heart icon, heart solid, , heart solid icon, , , , , , Vegan Chocolate Ice Cream, , , , , \u2605, \u2605, \u2605, \u2605, \u2605, , 4.5, from, 4, reviews, , , , , , Author:, , Ceara, , , , Total Time:, , 45 mins, , , , , , , , , , Print Recipe, , , , , Description, , , , , , , , , , , , , , Scale, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , , , 3 cups, full fat coconut milk (, 2, cans), , 2 tsp, tapioca starch, , 1 tbsp, vanilla extract, , 1 tbsp, instant coffee, , 1/2 tsp, sea salt, , 3/4 cup, cacao powder (or cocoa powder), , 1/2 cup, cane sugar, , 1/4 cup, maple syrup, , , , , , , , vanilla extract, cacao powder, coffee, sea salt, cane sugar, and maple syrup). Whisk over medium heat until the mixture starts to lightly simmer. Add the tapioca starch mixture and whisk until the mixtures begins to thicken (about 5 minutes)., , Pour mixture into a bowl and cover. Leave to cool in the fridge overnight or for an hour in the freezer. The ice cream mixture should be completely cool before mixing it in the ice cream maker., , Add the mixture to your (frozen \u2013 see note) ice cream maker and mix for about 20-30 minutes until your ice cream turns into a soft serve consistency. Do not over-mix (if you notice your ice cream has begun to melt it is time to freeze it) or else your ice cream will become icy and will not be as creamy., , Scoop ice cream into a glass dish (or loaf pan lined with parchment paper), cover and freeze for an hour or two until the ice cream is completely frozen. Scoop onto an ice cream cone, cover with chocolate sauce and enjoy!, , , , , , Notes, , , 1) Use only full-fat coconut milk in this recipe. Low-fat coconut milk will make icy (and not creamy) ice cream., 2) Make sure that your ice cream maker bowl is completely frozen before using it to make ice cream. It should be kept in the freezer overnight and there should not be any sloshing sound when you pick it up., 3) For the perfect ice cream scoop, take the ice cream out of the freezer and leave to soften for 2 minutes.
