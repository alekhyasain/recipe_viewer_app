I made it today and it was very good. I left out the mushrooms and swapped white onions for the red. I bought a bag of mixed peppers (red, orange and yellow) and used it. The seasonings were perfect. Unfortunately I had forgotten to buy limes and didn\u2019t have any lime juice on hand. Next time I will make sure to add the lime juice. The only other thing I did different was air fry the chopped veggies. At the current moment I don\u2019t have a skillet so I used my air fryer.

The blend of flavors and seasonings was perfect. I halved the recipe as I was the only one eating them. I used 1/2 of my tortilla mixture over 2 warmed corn tortillas. I topped each with a little Queso fresco and several slices of fresh avocado. I have refrigerated the remaining taco mixture and am hopeful that it will be delicious as leftovers. Thank you for a healthy, filling recipe. I loved using the zucchini since it is in season now, but am curious as to what other vegetables you might suggest in place of it when I make it this fall.

While potatoes were boiling, I saut\u00e9ed a red and green bell pepper in some evoo and a teaspoon of the taco seasoning then set aside.  After the potatoes boiled, I pat dry. Then I cooked the potatoes and the rest of the seasoning in a pan alone so they had dry room to crisp up.  I let them sit for at least 5-7 min as the recipe says then flip and do the same.  I didn\u2019t add extra black beans to the refried black bean mixture.  I also pan heated my tortillas for a little texture and smoky flavor. Lastly, I only used half vegan mayo in the sauce to make it a little looser.  Refri black beans, potatoes, peppers, some fresh onion and japs, cilantro, tomato, and cilantro jalape\u00f1o sauce..i WILL make these again!, , , , , , , , Rene, \u2014, June 26, 2020 @ 2:26 pm, , Reply, , , Yum!

When I\u2019m pressed on time, I put all the broccoli in a big mixing bowl coating it stepwise but all at once rather than doing each piece individually.

I was able to make them on my lunch break while working from home, and appreciated how quickly they came together. I made one burrito sized \u201ctaco\u201d as opposed to several smaller tacos. I was pleasantly surprised by just how filling it was. Instead of cabbage I added a bit of baby spinach, some carrot strands, and vegan cheddar shreds. It was delicious with the green goddess dressing!

        "Tahini Chickpea Tacos": "Ingredients: , There are three crucial \u2018elements\u2019 to the best homemade tacos. The first is the tortillas, the second is the main filling, and the third is the taco toppings!, , Tortillas:, , I actually use, Homemade Gluten-Free Tortillas, take less than 15 minutes to make, and are far healthier than many store-bought alternatives (with no preservatives and gums). In fact, with the inclusion of chickpea flour, these tortillas are vitamin and, mineral-rich, , including, copper, folate, manganese, magnesium, and Vitamins B1, B6, , etc., , I love to make a large batch of tortillas and keep them stored in the fridge/freezer for whenever the cravings hit. Oh, and If you\u2019re craving something a little different, then you might like my GF, Spinach Tortillas, ), which are also packed with healthy vitamins and minerals., , Vegan Taco Filling:, , When it comes to the filling, these gluten-free wraps contain a healthy, wholesome combination of, pan-fried chickpeas, green pepper, red cabbage, chopped tomatoes, , and, avocado chunks, . This is then topped with a, creamy tahini dressing, ., , However, plant-based tacos are super versatile when it comes to fillings and toppings, so there are tons of extra add-ins and tweaks that you can make to satisfy everyone\u2019s taste buds., , Optional Add-Ins:, , , Veggies:, Mushrooms, sweet potato, red onion, cauliflower, potato, grilled corn, cucumber, pickled red onion/cabbage, shredded lettuce, etc., , Herbs:, Green onion, cilantro, parsley, chives, scallions, etc., , Nuts/Seeds:, Pepitas, sunflower seeds, walnuts, cashews, etc., , Extra spices (for the pan-fried veg):, Chili powder, garlic, onion, smoked paprika, cumin, etc., , Other:, You may also want to crumble over your favorite vegan feta or shredded cheese. Plus, serve alongside some lime wedges, for extra \u2018zing.\u2019, , , For more, ingredient swaps and variations, , check out the recipe notes section at the end of this post., , The, ingredient measurements, and nutritional information, are in the recipe card below., , How To Make Chickpea Tacos, , These chickpea tacos can be eaten hot or cold, then you may need a little more water to thin it out., , Step 4 \u2013 Assemble, , If you want warm tortillas, then you can optionally fry them lightly for 1-2 minutes in a skillet or leave in the oven at a low-heat while preparing the fillings. You can then assemble the wraps and either top with any additional /herbs and serve as is or\u2026, , For Oven-Baked Tacos:, , Fill your tacos with the chickpea filling and press closed. It helps if you have a sauce so that they stay closed \u2013 like this, Vegan Cheese Sauce, ., Once filled, transfer the tortillas to a baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes at 410F/210C until crispy. Top with the veggies and eat immediately!, , How To Store, , Any leftover chickpeas can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for, 3-5 days, . Simply reheat in a skillet, as needed., , The fresh vegetables will need to be eaten sooner \u2013, best within 1-2 days, ., , Recipe Notes And Variations, , , You can use, hard taco shells, , instead of soft ones, if preferred., , For your avocado tacos filling, you can either use, chopped avocado, , whip up a quick, thick, guacamole, , or even make an, avocado cream, . To make avo cream blend the avocado with a little lemon/lime juice and water into a creamy consistency., , Feel free to sub out the tahini dressing for some, Vegan Sour Cream, ., , You could sub out the red cabbage for homemade, Keto Coleslaw, ., , You can also use this filling to make a, deconstructed taco bowl, . Fill a bowl with some leafy greens, the chickpea filling, and optionally some baked/fried tortillas., , You can also use this filling and the tortillas to make, chickpea fajitas, ., , For additional spice, , feel free to add some thinly sliced jalapeno peppers., , For an even, healthier version, , you can omit the GF tortillas in place of lettuce cups., , Though the flavor will vary, you can, swap out the chickpeas for other legumes, such as kidney beans, white beans, black beans, etc., , , Related Vegan Mexican Recipes, , , Oven-Roasted Vegetable Fajitas, , Vegan Spinach & Eggplant Quesadillas, , Easy Vegan Tortilla Soup, , Mexican Pinto Bean Soup, , Easy Instant Pot Refried Beans, , Spinach Oven Baked Tacos, , Vegan Taquitos, , , If you give this chickpea tacos recipe a try, I\u2019d love a, comment and recipe rating, below.

I was sceptical about the dressing but I couldn\u2019t stop licking while I mixed it! And it complemented the chickpea salad so so well. The tortillas were the best surprise. Ok, first off, mine are not gluten free (dont cringe-sorry) but I have searched for weeks on end for chickpea flour in vain. So I used spelt flour (richer, perhaps heavier) but still did a perfect job (I guess as I ate my first one!
