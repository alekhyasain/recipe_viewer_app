        "Vegan Cashew Queso": "Ingredients: REALLY good. It really is the best vegan cashew queso., , It\u2019s SO CHEESY, creamy, packed with flavor and so much healthier than any cheese dip!, , What\u2019s in it?, First, can we just take a minute to bow down to, cashews, ? I LOVE using cashews in my recipes! They are so creamy when boiled and mixed up in a blender. You can totally transform the taste and they are loaded with nutrients!, , They are a good source of, heart-healthy fats, magnesium, zinc, protein and antioxidants., I highly suggest buying them raw., , , Next in line-, nutritional yeast., If you\u2019re not new to vegan cooking, you\u2019ve probably heard of nutritional yeast but if you are new to this, nutritional yeast is an inactive yeast that has a cheesy/nutty flavor., It\u2019s important to note that not all nutritional yeast is created equal!, , , Some are fortified, some aren\u2019t. I personally like to use one that is non-fortified. Aside from the added synthetic vitamins, nutritional yeast is actually naturally full of vitamins and minerals (although b12 is not naturally occurring in any plant-based food)., , Given the extra b-vitamins, one could argue that the fortified yeast\u2019s have health benefits but my personal opinion is to go non-fortified because some people don\u2019t handle all of those synthetic vitamins very well. Again, that is just my opinion but I do believe the fortified ones can be a great option for some people!, , How to Make, , There are, 3 main steps, to this recipe., , First, boil your cashews. Second, heat it up! I like to reuse the pot I boiled the cashews in because, less dishes=happy mama., , After the cashews are done, about 20 minutes, drain and rinse and set aside to cool for about 5 minutes. Once cooled, except salsa, into the food processor/high speed blender. Blend until smooth., , Once the cashew queso is smooth, transfer it to the same pot you boiled the cashews in and turn the stove to medium-low. I like to add my salsa at this point for a chunky queso, but if you want your dip really smooth you can blend it in the blender., , The possibilities are endless with this queso dip! Use in taco bowls, dip for chips/veggies, drizzle over steamed veggies, get creative!, , , , , , , The Best Vegan Cashew Queso [GF], , , Vegan, gluten-free and oil-free super tasty vegan cashew queso dip.

They\u2019re trying the vegan life and one of them is lactose intolerant so I thought \u201cwhy not try this out?\u201d It was easy to make, everything you need is most likely already in your pantry, and it was not time consuming at all. The final product was so creamy and you can hardly tell it isn\u2019t the real thing. You do have to make sure you blend as much as possible to get the extra creamy consistency and a very good taco seasoning really does make all the difference. Everyone loved it and I was in awe. I know I\u2019ll be making it for all of my post Covid get togethers.  Thanks for the recipe!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Alexandria McAndrew, , says, , , February 23, 2021 at 1:19 am, , , , Yay!
