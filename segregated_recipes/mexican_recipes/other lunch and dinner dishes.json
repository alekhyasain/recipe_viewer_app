Among many other things, he specifically dislikes legumes, corn tortillas, spinach, and cottage cheese., He never entered the kitchen while I was putting this together, but while it was cooking, he walked through and remarked how good it smelled.

        "Black Bean Tamale Pie": "Ingredients: , For the black bean chili filling:, , , Olive oil, , Aromatics like onion and garlic cloves, , Green or Red bell pepper, , Zucchini, , Spices like chili powder, cayenne pepper, cumin and ground coriander, , Canned black beans, , Canned diced tomatoes with juice, , , For the cornmeal tamale topping:, , , Ground cornmeal, , Whole-wheat flour (or use gluten-free flour for gluten free option), , Baking powder, , Canola oil, , Maple syrup, , Unsweetened soymilk, or dairy-free milk of choice, , Apple cider vinegar or other vinegar; you just need a splash of acidity, , Can of diced green chilis, mild or hot depending on spice preferences, , 1/2 cup corn (thawed from frozen or canned), , , , , , zucchini, bell pepper and garlic. Heat the olive oil in a large cast-iron, skillet, or stock pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened., , From there, stir in the zucchini and bell pepper and cook another 5 minutes until tender. Sprinkle in the spices along with the drained and rinsed black beans and tomatoes with their juices., , Just like regular chili, you can season until your heart\u2019s content. I use the usual suspects: chili powder, cayenne, cumin and coriander but feel free to turn up the heat with chopped jalape\u00f1os or other spices., , If you plan on using the same pan then you\u2019ll need to choose a large skillet. I like my 12\u2033 cast-iron skillet but any oven-safe option will work., , , , , Make the cornmeal crust, , Now comes the best part\u2013 the cornbread crust. Essentially, tamale pie is just chili and cornbread combined together in one pan. And for me, it\u2019s not chili unless I\u2019ve got a side of cornbread. I\u2019m using my favorite, cornbread, , While the chili is cooking, mix up the cornbread filling and set aside. If you cooked the chili in an oven safe skillet, like a cast-iron then you are ready to go. Otherwise, you can pour the bean mixture to a casserole dish or other oven-safe skillet., , Top with the cornbread filling, then place in the oven and cook until hot and bubbly., , Pie goes in the oven, delicious dinner comes out. How great is that? If you decide to use a casserole pan or, baking dish, for this instead of a, skillet, , make sure your chili is fairly saucy. It will dry out as it cooks in the oven and you want enough moisture to create the best part of this meal \u2014> the thin layer of soggy cornbread that\u2019s been baked in chili juice., , The top layer is slightly crunchy, the underneath is perfectly soggy. The texture is so perfect. Good luck not picking off the cornbread topping as you dish this one up!, , , , , Shortcut Options, , For an easy weeknight shortcut, you can use any box mix that you\u2019d like for the cornbread topping. If using a boxed version, then I highly recommend adding in the canned chilis and cheddar, either regular or dairy-free cheese to elevate the boxed version., , Or, alternatively you can use any chili recipe and top with this homemade cornbread topping., , What to top this vegetarian tamale pie with?, , You can top this pie with whatever you\u2019d like. I usually go with avocado slices, fresh cilantro, salsa and thinly sliced scallions., , , , , More One Pot Dinner Recipes:, , , One Skillet Dinner with Sausage and Potatoes, , Healthy Vegan Enchilada Casserole, , Quinoa Enchilada Casserole, , Pasta Bake with No-Cook Noodles, , Sheet Pan Maple Balsamic Tempeh and Vegetables, , One Pot Pasta Puttanesca, , , If you try this recipe, let me know!

A smaller pan works, but the cornbread topping ends up being too thick., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Kaci, , says:, , , , at, , , , , This is like a 4.5/5, realllly good and so easy. My biggest complaint that didn\u2019t get it to a 5/5 is the cornbread needed a little something extra, its was kinda bland. Of course, with the filling on the bottom it was a delicious combo, but if you got a bite that was mostly cornbread, it lacked something. I think maybe a little more maple syrup and some salt would do the trick. Definitely making this in the future again!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Alex, , says:, , , , at, , , , , Thanks for the feedback Kaci! I\u2019m redoing the recipe based on similar feedback.

August 2023 at 17:59, , , , fantastic recipe. made my own filling of roasted butternut squash and impossible beef flavored with onion, garlic, seasonings \u2013 the works. the dough is immaculate, I think I subbed out about 0.5 oz of vegan butter with olive oil which worked perfectly. I also used whole foods 365 almond milk from the carton instead of water when making the dough and empanadas baked at about 14-16 minutes 390 F great for me in the bella air fryer. I followed the dough recipe pretty precisely, making sure to remove from the fridge after approximately 30 minutes. few things to note \u2013 the more thin you roll out your dough, might compromise the structure and flakiness of the empanada, keep it almost thin but thick enough to hold etc. I wish I put half my dough away while I rolled out and stuffed the first half because it felt like it was drying out just a little (not enough for concern), so by the time I got to the second half it just didn\u2019t have the same maximum and freshness of moisture which I\u2019ll be more mindful of next time I make it.

Please try again., , , , , Instructions: Dough:, Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Then form a mold in the center of the flour., Melt the vegan butter in a saucepan. Allow to cool slightly, then pour it into the flour mold. Pour in dairy-free milk (or water) and knead everything until a nice smooth dough forms., Then form the dough into a ball, wrap tightly in cling film, and place in the fridge to chill for at least \u00bd hour.*, Filling:, Thaw and squeeze out the spinach., Peel and finely chop the onion and the garlic., Heat the oil in a pan. Saut\u00e9 chopped onion and garlic briefly. Then add the spinach and season with salt, pepper, a bit of nutmeg, and chili to taste. Set aside and let cool slightly before adding the vegan cheese., Remove the dough from the fridge and knead again on a lightly floured surface. Then roll it out and cut out 4-inch (10 cm) diameter circles (, I used a big glass to do that, ). Collect the remaining dough and knead it together into a ball. Then roll it out again, and cut out more circles of dough. Continue this process until all of the dough is used up., Place 1-2 tsp of the filling in the center of each dough circle and fold the empanadas into a half-moon shape. Then press the edges together firmly using a fork., Brush a baking tray with oil (, or line it with parchment paper, ) and arrange the stuffed empanadas onto it., Mix the olive oil, soy milk, and turmeric to combine, then brush the filled empanadas with it., Bake them in a preheated oven at 392\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for about 20 minutes, until golden brown and crispy. (, Optionally, you can also deep fry them, )., Serve your vegan empanadas hot or cold., Enjoy!, , , Notes, , Instead of all-purpose or spelt\u00a0flour,\u00a0you can also use gluten-free (pre-cooked) cornflour, or combine both types of flour. You could also use a gluten-free 1 to 1 all-purpose flour blend, however, I do not recommend using whole grain flour., ",

Wash out and dry your bowl and lightly coat your dough with olive oil. Leave the dough in the bowl and cover with a towel. Leave to rise for 1 hour to an hour and a half or until the dough roughly doubles in size., Preheat the oven to 260\u00b0C (500\u00b0F)., Roll out your dough on a lightly oiled pan to about 30 cm / 12 inches (this is a medium-thick crust, you can roll it out bigger for a thinner crust). Use a fork to poke some holes in the base then bake for 10 \u2013 15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown., For the vegan taco meat: Combine the TVP and water in a bowl for a few minutes until the TVP is hydrated. Heat a medium pan over medium-high heat and add the oil",
