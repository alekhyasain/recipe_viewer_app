If you want an even lower-carb version of this recipe, skip the beans. With an approved tortilla, this tostada would work for phase 2 or 3 of the original South Beach Diet.

If you want an even lower-carb version of this recipe, skip the beans. With an approved tortilla, this tostada would work for phase 2 or 3 of the original South Beach Diet.

        "Portobello Vegan Fajitas": "Ingredients: , Avocado oil (or preferred oil), Portobello Mushrooms, Bell Peppers,, Red Onion, Salt and Pepper., , How to Make Vegan Fajitas, , STEP 1, - Blend up the fajita sauce and set it aside., , STEP 2, - Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms until perfectly browned and set aside., , STEP 3, - In the same pan, saut\u00e9 the onions and peppers until slightly tender and somewhat charred., , STEP 4, -\u00a0Add the sauce and cook for a few minutes to incorporate flavors., , How to Serve, , They are delicious with warm corn tortillas, lime wedges, fresh-cut cilantro, , vegan sour cream, , guacamole, or, Spanish Rice and Beans, , but feel free to get creative. They are pretty spicy, but if you want to turn up the heat, add your favorite hot sauce or salsa., , , Tips for Cooking Mushrooms, , , The key to flavorful veggies is perfectly browning and caramelizing them. Make sure your heat is high enough and don't add them to the pan until it's hot. You should hear that familiar sizzle right away!, , Don't overcrowd the pan when saute\u00e9ing the mushrooms or they will steam instead of searing and browning. They need lots of room, so you may need to cook the portobellos in two batches., , To clean mushrooms, use a dry, slightly damp paper towel or a soft brush to clean each mushroom. Mushrooms are like sponges and will absorb a lot of water which can make the mushrooms soggy., , The brown gills on the mushrooms can be gently scraped if desired. They make the vegetable mixture a little darker, but it doesn't affect the taste. I usually leave them intact., , , An alternative to Fajita Sauce, , If you think the sauce might be too spicy for your taste, you can omit it altogether. Instead, add the dry spices, (garlic powder, cumin, chili powder), when the cooked mushrooms go into the pan of saute\u00e9d onions and peppers. You can add \u00bd teaspoon of smoked paprika too.

Once they have reduced their size and are fully browned, sprinkle with a generous pinch of salt & pepper., (*optional: to deglaze, splash some sherry into the pan - this will pick up some brown bits and add more flavor to your mushrooms)., Remove from heat and place mushrooms on a plate or bowl., Heat the same large pan, between, , medium and medium-high heat, .\u00a0When it's hot, add 2 tablespoons of oil. As soon as the oil gets hot and shimmery, add the onions and peppers, (you should hear a sizzle), . Now add a generous pinch of salt & pepper. Stir occasionally, but don't move them\u00a0around too much, so they have time to\u00a0get nicely browned and somewhat charred. This will create a robust flavor., Saut\u00e9 until lightly tender and browned about 6-8 minutes., (*optional: to deglaze, splash some sherry into the pan), Now add the cooked mushrooms and fajita sauce. You'll want to stir frequently at this point to prevent burning the sauce. Taste for seasoning and add if needed. Cook for 1-2 minutes and remove from heat. Serve immediately., , , Notes, * Cleaning Mushrooms:, Use a dry, slightly damp paper towel or a soft brush to clean each mushroom. Mushrooms are like sponges and will absorb a lot of water which can make the mushrooms soggy. * The brown gills can be gently scraped if desired. They make the vegetable mixture a little darker, but it doesn't affect the taste. I usually leave them intact., , , , , , *Saute\u00e9ing Mushrooms:, don't overcrowd the pan when saute\u00e9ing the mushrooms or they will steam instead of searing. They need lots of room. You may need to cook the portobellos in two batches., , , , , , *Warming Tortillas:, , Place a tortilla in a cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium heat, (don\u2019t add oil), . Cook for 30 seconds on each side. Remove and cover with a slightly damp dish towel to keep soft & warm. Repeat with remaining tortillas. *Start this step before the fajitas are finished so everything will be nice and hot., , , , , , *Quicker option:, You can cook the mushrooms at the same time as the onions and peppers, just use 2 separate pans., , , , Nutrition, Serving:, 1, (2 fajitas), |, Calories:, 295, kcal, |, Carbohydrates:, 42, g, |, Protein:, 3, g, |, Fat:, 11, g, |, Saturated Fat:, 1, g, |, Sodium:, 249, mg, |, Potassium:, 204, mg, |, Fiber:, 2, g, |, Sugar:, 3, g, |, Vitamin A:, 2715, IU, |, Vitamin C:, 107.4, mg, |, Calcium:, 21, mg, |, Iron:, 1, mg, , , , Tried this recipe?, Follow me, @veganhuggs, and mention, #veganhuggs, !, , , , , , , , , , Vegan Huggs Weekly Newsletter, , Receive the tastiest vegan recipes straight to your inbox!

Yes, you can use the paste instead of the sauce. Each brand might vary regarding the spice level, so you may want to use caution so it's not overly spicy. I'm so glad you'll give them a try.

        "Tofu Sofritos": "Ingredients: How To Make This Recipe, Tips & Tricks, Storing, Freezing, Related Recipes, I Love To Hear From You!, , Why This Recipe Works, , If you love Chipotle\u00a0tofu sofritas, then this is the right place for you. This recipe is the, perfect copy-cat recipe, and it tastes just like the original!, , Made with crumbled tofu, a medley of aromatic spices, and a zesty blend of tomatoes and peppers, this recipe works like magic to deliver a burst of flavors that will keep you coming back for more., , I absolutely love this recipe because it is\u00a0incredibly versatile, , bursting with bold flavors, , and offers a protein-packed alternative to traditional meat-based dishes. It\u00a0can be enjoyed in a variety of ways \u2013\u00a0as a filling for tacos and, burritos, , a topping for rice bowls, or even a flavorful addition to salads., , I experimented with this recipe quite a bit to get it perfect for you. For the best results, I recommend frying the tofu first and then crumble it when it\u2019s nicely browned. The crumbled tofu soaks up the savory spices and seasonings, creating a satisfying and meaty texture that will have even the most die-hard meat lovers asking for seconds., , The marinade, couldn\u2019t be any easier, . It\u2019s made of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, a green bell pepper, tomato paste, a fresh tomato, oregano, smoked paprika powder, garlic, and a bit of salt., , Many sofrita recipes call for roasting a poblano pepper, but I wanted to create an easier recipe that is perfect for busy weeknights. So I skipped this step and used a canned chipotle pepper instead, which works perfectly., , For ultimate flavor, simmer the crumbled tofu in the marinade for 15 minutes. It\u2019s very, easy to adjust the spice level, of the marinade to your personal preference by using more or less of the chipotle peppers., , You can also adjust the amount of salt to your personal liking. \u00a0And let\u2019s not forget that making sofritas at home is, much cheaper, . Trust me, once you try this recipe, you\u2019ll be hooked!, , , , , , , , Firm Tofu, \u2013 Don\u2019t use soft or silken tofu for this recipe as it has a different texture. For best results use extra firm tofu., , Chipotle Pepper, \u2013 canned whole chipotles in adobo sauce, , Adobo Sauce, \u2013 from the canned chipotle pepper, , Smoked Paprika Powder, \u2013 if possible don\u2019t replace it with regular paprika powder as it has a very unique and smoky taste., , Salsa, \u2013 use your favorite kind of salsa., , Garlic, \u2013 fresh., , , , , How To Make This Recipe, , , , 1. Step, : Drain the tofu. Wrap it in paper towels and squeeze out as much of the excess water as possible. Cut it into slices., , 2. Step, : In a large non-stick frying pan, heat some oil and cook the tofu on high heat until it\u2019s nicely browned on both sides. This should take about 8 minutes., , 3. Step, : In the meantime, , 4. Step, : When the tofu is nicely browned, use a wooden spoon to crumble it. The crumbles shouldn\u2019t be too small., , , 5. Step, : Add the sauce to the tofu., , 6. Step, : Stir well., , 7. Step, : Simmer for 15 minutes on medium heat., , 8. Step, : Serve with burritos, tacos, or in a burrito bowl with brown rice, lettuce, guacamole, and vegan sour cream., , Tips & Tricks, , , Make sure to use very firm tofu. The recipe doesn\u2019t work with soft tofu because it doesn\u2019t crumble and it also doesn\u2019t absorb sauces well., , If your tofu is not firm enough, press it for 20-30 minutes before you start with the recipe. You could do this by placing a stack of cookbooks on top or by using a tofu press. I posted a post on, how to cook tofu, a while ago that also explains how to press tofu., , Adjust the level of spiciness to your personal liking by using more or less of the chipotle peppers. We liked one chipotle and about two tablespoons of the adobo sauce, but feel free to adjust the amount you\u2019re using., , I love serving the sofritas with brown rice, black beans, lettuce, guacamole, vegan sour cream, nachos, and maybe a bit of vegan shredded cheese. So good!, , , , Storing, , Stored in an airtight container in the fridge, the sofritas will last up to, 3-4 days, ., , Freezing, , This recipe freezes pretty well. Let it cool down completely after cooking, then transfer it into a freezer-safe container.

It is a go to in our house for Mexican suppers. Serve it with a side of refried beans, a chopped kale salad, salsa, taco salad dressing, and chips or rice. Yummy!, , , Reply, , , , , , , , George S., , , March 05, 2023 at 8:02 pm, , , , Wow! This recipe is delicious. I kinda cheated with the tomatoes and substituted a can of diced tomatoes and omitted the tomato paste (by accident) and salsa because I used some of the juice from the diced tomatoes. It came out simply delicious. Much props for the recipe! I put some sofritas in a flour tortilla with cheese, and warmed it up in a dry pan!  Can\u2019t wait to try it, similar to a Chipotle bowl., , , Reply, , , , , , , , GEM, , , February 21, 2023 at 2:26 am, , , , This recipe was BETTER than Chipotle.

Once the potatoes, cashews and carrots are done cooking strain them if there is any water left. Place it into a blender along with the nutritional yeast, salt, vegan cheddar shreds and non-dairy milk. Blend until smooth. You may need to add more non-dairy milk to get it very smooth. Taste it and make sure there is enough salt., Begin the rice by bringing it to a boil and then dropping it to a simmer for 15-20 minutes or until all water has been absorbed. Rice should be fluffy. Once it has cooked add in the taco seasoning, tomato sauce and salt. Stir to combine., To prepare the vegan ground \u201cbeef\u201d start by adding the oil and onion into a pan on a low heat. Once the onions are translucent and fragrant add in the ground \u201cbeef\u201d and cook for 5-10 minutes. Add in the taco seasoning., Make the quesadilla by adding a bit of spray oil, oil or vegan butter into a pan on a low heat. Add in \u2153 cup of vegan cheese in between two tortillas. Place a lid on top to help the cheese melt better. After 3-5 minutes vegan cheese should be melted. DO NOT BURN THE QUESADILLA. It is easier to roll the quesadilla up when it is softer., Take the quesadilla out and turn the stove off."
