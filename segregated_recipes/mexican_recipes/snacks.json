The Tofu marinade was fantastic and the chimichurri sauce, OH MY HEAVENS!!! I was in heaven! I am going to triple the sauce and use it on chicken and even as a dip for veggies.  Hands down the best tofu marinade I have had so far.  I am new to tofu due to new dietary restrictions, and have been scared to death to try new ideas.  This one hit it out of the park for me.

        "Spicy Black Bean Nachos": "Ingredients: other Mexican recipes, you can make., , , Spicy Black Bean Nachos Recipe, , We're building this delight using canned beans as that is easiest, but of course you are welcome to use\u00a02 cups\u00a0of, homemade beans, , if you have some on hand., , Roughly chop 1/2 an onion and peel 2 garlic cloves. \u00a0Saute in a dollop of oil\u00a0over medium heat for 5-7 minutes., , , Rinse and drain a can of black beans and add to the onion mixture, along with 2, chipotles in adobo, , 1 Tablespoon adobo sauce, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt, freshly ground pepper, and 1/2 cup of water (or stock)., , , , , , You're left with a delicious bean puree that is capable of both drizzling and clinging at the same time. \u00a0If for any reason your batch comes out too liquidy (to cling to chips) then you can saute it over mediumish heat for a few minutes and it will reduce to a thicker consistency. \u00a0(We also use this puree in our, Black Bean and Guacamole Tostadas, )., , And note that using 2 chipotles in adobo creates real heat! \u00a0I tend to make this bean mixture extra spicy knowing that it will be diluted down by the chips and fixings. \u00a0Using only a single chipotle is a good option if you're not a huge fan of spicy foods., , , , And now I'm going to make a suggestion\u00a0that might send some of you nacho experts running for the hills...., , I think these nachos taste\u00a0best when they are done in moderation. \u00a0I know, I know, nachos are an infrequent\u00a0delight designed\u00a0to be over the top goopy decadence, amirite?!, , This version tries to have the best of both nacho worlds: \u00a0some goopy decadence but also some restraint so that the beany cheesy flavors stay at the forefront. \u00a0In other words, don't dump everything in the kitchen on top of them. \u00a0I've made double and triple layer batches of nachos before and they quickly\u00a0turn into a soggy mess., , So while you'll have enough quantity to make a double layer batch, this recipe far prefers a single layer of nachos, ensuring that you'll always have chips in tact and they'll be warm and crispy. \u00a0Nachos!, , Start by creating a dense, single layer of chips on a sheetpan. \u00a0Drizzle with some of the bean mixture and add a layer of cheese. \u00a0I'm using a mix of Monterey Jack and Cheddar., , , This gets baked in the oven at 400F for 5-7 minutes or until the cheese is thoroughly melted., , And now give yourself a quick pat on the back as all the hard work is done. \u00a0The combo of warm chips, melted cheese and spicy black beans is good enough to be eaten on its own and the rest is just a bonus that\u00a0can be customized to your liking., , I think a, fresh, cool Avocado Salsa Verde, is the perfect complement to cheesy nachos so consider that a good option for these Spicy Black Bean Nachos., , 1, , can black beans, 1/2, , onion, 2, , garlic cloves, 2, , chipotles in adobo, 1, , tablespoon, , adobo sauce, 1/2, , teaspoon, , cumin, 1/2, , teaspoon, , salt, freshly ground pepper, 1/2, , cup, , water, , (or stock), 1, , bag tortilla chips, 4-5, , cups, , shredded Monterey Jack cheese, oil, jalapeno slices, , (optional), chopped cilantro, , (optional), Avocado Salsa Verde, 4, , tomatillos, 1/2, , onion, 1, , garlic clove, 1/2, , jalapeno, 10-12, , sprigs cilantro, 1, , avocado, salt to taste, but I doubled it), 1, , tomato, 1/4, , onion, 1/2, , jalapeno, 10-12, , sprigs cilantro, juice of 1/2 lime, 1/4, , teaspoon, , salt, , , , , , Salsas, , , , Starting a Food Blog, , , , , Enchilada Recipes, , , , , About Me, , , , , Contact, , , , , Disclaimer, , , , , \u00a9 2025, Mexican Please, , - Privacy Policy, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Instructions: you are roasting some tomatillos and combining them with onion, garlic, cilantro, jalapeno, and avocado., , , You're left with vibrant salsa that does wonders in this dish., , Additional garnishes, all of them optional, include tomatoes, jalapeno slices, avocado bits, cilantro, and Cotija cheese., , I combined a few of those options and made a quick double batch of our default, Pico de Gallo recipe, that you'll find, here, ., , , So this nachos version is topped with drizzled, Avocado Salsa Verde, , jalapeno slices, Pico de Gallo, and a sprinkling of cilantro., , , One last thing...., , Keep the bowl of spicy black beans close by to give yourself the much deserved option of double dipping, i.e. dipping the warm cheesy chips into both the beans, and, the Avocado Salsa Verde. \u00a0Because you deserve it., , , Tough to beat beany cheesy tortilla chips eh?, , Nachos!, , , , , Spicy Black Bean Nachos, , , It's tough to beat the combo of warm tortilla chips, melted cheese, and spicy black beans.

This is enough cheese for three single layer batches., Add a dense, single layer of chips to a sheet pan. (You can line the sheetpan with foil or parchment paper if you want to make cleanup easier)., Drizzle some of the beans over the chips.\u00a0\u00a0Add a layer of cheese to the chips.\u00a0 Bake in the oven at 400F for 5-7 minutes or until all the cheese is melted., Top with your favorite fixings and serve immediately., This batch was drizzled with Avocado Salsa Verde and topped with Pico de Gallo, chopped cilantro, and jalapeno slices., If you are making Avocado Salsa Verde, start by rinsing four fresh tomatillos.\u00a0 I usually cut out the stems too.\u00a0\u00a0Roast the tomatillos in the oven at 400F until cooked through and they start to turn army green., Add the roasted tomatillos to a blender along with \u00bd onion, 1 garlic clove, 10-12 sprigs cilantro, and \u00bd of a jalapeno pepper.\u00a0\u00a0Pulse blend and taste for heat, adding the additional \u00bd of the jalapeno if you want more heat. Add the flesh of the avocado to the blender and combine well.\u00a0\u00a0Salt to taste., If you are making Pico de Gallo, start by finely chopping the tomato, 1/4 onion, and 1/2 jalapeno into \u00bc\" sized chunks.\u00a0\u00a0Finely dice the cilantro.\u00a0\u00a0Combine the tomato, onion, jalapeno and cilantro in a mixing bowl.\u00a0\u00a0Add \u00bc teaspoon salt and the juice of a \u00bd lime.\u00a0\u00a0Mix together well and taste for seasoning.\u00a0\u00a0Add additional salt and lime if necessary., , Notes, Keep the beans close by so you have the option of dipping the chips in both the beans and the Avocado Salsa Verde., , Using two chipotles in adobo gives the beans real kick. If you want a milder version you can use a single chipotle or even 1/2 of a chipotle. Note that some of the heat will get diluted once you combine the beans with all the fixings, so my version tastes extra spicy right out of the blender., , Feel free to use cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack.
