Nobody's quite sure. Some people speculate that the name comes from the way it was originally eaten (with the hands, by pinching the thumb and forefinger)., , , , , , , , , , , , , DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS, , , , Pico de Gallo vs. Salsa, , , Pico de gallo is a type of salsa, but it's probably different from the kind you get at your local Mexican restaurant., , , It contains less liquid than traditional salsa, and pico de gallo is never blended (salsas can vary from pureed to gently mashed, , , , , , , , , Tomatoes:, Roma (plum) tomatoes are perfect for pico de gallo because they're less watery than other varieties. Choose ripe, red tomatoes that are firm and plump., Onion:, This recipe calls for red onions instead of the traditional white onions, so it packs a flavorful punch. Of course, you can use whichever onions you prefer., Cilantro:, Fresh cilantro adds fresh flavor and vibrant green color. If you don't like cilantro, you can leave it out or substitute with parsley., Jalape\u00f1o:, Turn up the heat with fresh jalape\u00f1o. If you want to go the more traditional route, try serrano peppers instead., Lime:, Lime juice lends fruity flavor. It also keeps the pico de gallo tasting and looking fresh for longer., Garlic:, This recipe calls for both fresh and powdered garlic. The result? A powerfully garlicky pico de gallo., Cumin:, A pinch of cumin adds warmth, nuttiness, and just a touch of sweetness to this pico de gallo recipe., Salt and Pepper:, Salt and pepper enhance the other flavors and are the perfect finishing touch., , , , , Test Kitchen Tips, , , \u201cHomemade pico de gallo is fresher, more colorful, crunchier, and cheaper [than the store-bought stuff], so why not make it yourself?\u201d asks culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a., NicoleMcMom, ). Here are some of her expert tips for making the best pico de gallo at home:, , , , \u201cThe recipe calls for half a jalape\u00f1o, but this is where you have to use your best judgment,\u201d says Nicole. \u201cI always use more jalape\u00f1o than it calls for.\u201d, If you like your pico de gallo extra hot, leave in the seeds., , , , , Is Pico de Gallo Spicy?, , , use more spicy peppers and leave in some seeds. If you don't, forgo the peppers \u2014 you can simply leave them out or replace them with an ingredient you prefer, such as green bell peppers, black beans, or corn., , , , How to Store Pico de Gallo, , , Homemade pico de gallo is best served fresh, so plan to enjoy it on the day you make it. If you need to keep it a little longer, you can store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days., , , , How to Use Pico de Gallo, , , There are plenty of ways to use pico de gallo: Serve it with tortilla chips, use it as a taco topping, use it as an ingredient in quesadillas or burritos, or mix it into scrambled eggs or Spanish rice., , , , Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise, , , \"Simply awesome,\" according to, Amber Nevland, . \"I left this in the fridge for approximately 1 hour after mixing. Excellent flavor and aroma!\", , , \"I made this today and it is terrific,\" raves, Jenn, . \"This will be a go-to at our house from now on. I doubled the onion and garlic based on other reviews and it was perfect for us...we tend to like a lot of both of those.
