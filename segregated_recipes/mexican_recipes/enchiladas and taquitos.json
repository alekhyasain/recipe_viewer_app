        "Vegan Enchiladas": "Ingredients: zesty, and you\u2019ll never want to stop eating it. Here are a few notes on incorporating this sauce into these vegan enchiladas:, , , It\u2019s cheaper to make homemade., This recipe calls for 3 cups enchilada sauce. Alex and I priced out our favorite brand and it would be $12 to make this recipe! The homemade version weighs in at around $5., , Make it the day before for quick assembly., It takes about 30 minutes to make the enchilada sauce. We recommend making it the day before and refrigerating until serving. Or, you can\u2026, , It adds about 15 minutes to the prep time (and a dirty pan & blender)., If you make it the day of, it will add about 15 minutes to the recipe, since you can simmer it while you make the enchilada filling. Just know you\u2019ll have a little more to clean up, too!, , , , How to assemble these vegan enchiladas, , Assembling these vegan enchiladas is the hardest part. How to make sure you have the right amount of filling so it doesn\u2019t spill out? How to make sure the tortillas don\u2019t split? Here are our tips:, , , Don\u2019t overfill the tortillas., It\u2019s easy to want to put in way too much filling. All you need is \u00bc cup veggies and 2 tablespoons guacamole. Spread them in a line like you see below., , Roll them tightly and place seam side down., Placing seam side down helps them stay rolled., , If using corn tortillas, use a good brand and cook in oil prior to rolling., Corn tortillas taste great and are gluten-free, , , , , Scale, , 1x, 2x, 3x, , , , , , , 3 cups, , Homemade Red Enchilada Sauce, or purchased sauce, , 2 tablespoons, olive oil, , 2, large portobello mushroom caps, , 1/2, medium red onion, , 1, orange bell pepper, , 15, -ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed, , 1 teaspoon, garlic powder, , 2 teaspoons, cumin, , 1 teaspoon, onion powder, , 1 teaspoon, paprika, , 1 teaspoon, , kosher salt, , 2 tablespoons, lime juice, , \u00bd cup, , vegetable broth, (leftover from the enchilada sauce recipe) or water, , 1 \u00bd cups, , guacamole, (homemade or purchased), , 12, 8-inch flour or corn tortillas (read section above), , For the garnish: 1 cup thinly sliced romaine lettuce, 1 to 2 radishes cut into matchsticks, 2 tablespoons minced red onion, and torn cilantro, , Optional:, Vegan sour cream, , , , , , , , , , , , Cook Mode, , Prevent your screen from going dark, , , , , , ,  Instructions: , , Here\u2019s what the inside of one of the tortillas should look like!, , Flour tortillas vs corn tortillas: which are better for enchiladas?, , Corn tortillas are more traditional in Mexican-style enchiladas. Flour tortillas are more traditional in American style enchiladas. There are pros and cons to both! When we tested this vegan enchiladas recipe, we had a lot of issues with corn tortillas that split open when we went to roll them. Here are some pros and cons to each:, , , Corn tortillas, are gluten-free and more authentic Mexican. But many brands easily split when you go to roll them! To combat this, find the best corn tortilla brand you can. Then brush it with oil and cook it 15 seconds per side before assembling. Doing so can help to make it more supple for rolling (and infuses a little flavor)., , Flour tortillas, are more authentic to American enchiladas. They\u2019re not gluten-free but they are much easier to roll! We also both loved how gooey they get when soaked in the enchilada sauce., , , , Homemade vs purchased guacamole, , Our homemade, guacamole recipe, is, so, good, it\u2019s worth making if you have time! But since storebought guacamole is so easily available, we\u2019d recommend getting your favorite purchased brand to speed up prep time for the recipe. It takes about 15 minutes to make the guacamole. If you\u2019re making of the components at home, we\u2019d recommend the, enchilada sauce, instead., , But if you do have time, it\u2019s worth making this incredible homemade guacamole, and you can use the extras as a side dish. You could also make it ahead and store it using this storage tip so it doesn\u2019t brown: refrigerate it with 1/2\u2033 of water on top of the guac. This serves as a barrier to the air and works like a charm!, , , Sides to serve with vegan enchiladas, , These enchiladas are a stunning, vegan dish, that\u2019s perfect for dinner parties or weeknight meals. What to serve with these vegan enchiladas to make it a full meal? We\u2019ve got lots of options.

Turn off the heat., Also, add the mashed potatoes and vegan cheese (you can use store-bought grated, vegan cheese, or cream cheese). I used my, easy vegan cheese sauce, .

        "Vegan lentil enchiladas": "Ingredients: plant-based, nut-free, perfect for lunch or dinner, and very tasty., , , Can we please take a moment to appreciate these wholesome vegetarian enchiladas? This dish was a big hit in my house, super yummy, and I can\u2019t wait to make it again! Has your mouth started watering yet?, , , How Healthy Are Lentil Enchiladas?, , You might ask why I used, lentils, to make these enchiladas rojas. Well, I love lentils \u2013 they are an, amazing source of healthy protein, and contain lots of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. For example, lentils are rich in folate, copper, manganese, phosphorus, iron, and zinc., , They have a great taste and texture and combined with flavorful spices, they can have a similar taste to ground meat. That\u2019s why they are the perfect filling for veggie enchiladas. I also love that lentils are, inexpensive, , they, cook much faster, than beans or chickpeas, and they are even easier to digest., , Besides lentils, like sunflower seeds, rolled oats, bell peppers, tomato, carrot, onion, ground chia seeds, tomato paste, and flavorful spices., , For the, measurements, and nutrition facts (calories, etc.), , please check the printable recipe card below., , , How to Make Vegan Enchiladas, , , salt + pepper, the oats, the sunflower seeds, and the ground chia seeds) into a food processor and blend for about 20-30 seconds., , , Step 5: Add Veggies, , Add the cooked veggies and the tomato paste, and blend again., , , Step 6: Add Cooked Lentils, , Finally, add the cooked lentils and blend until everything is combined. The mixture should stick together and the texture should look like in the pics below. If the mixture isn\u2019t thick enough or doesn\u2019t stick together, then add more ground oats., , , Step 7: Preheat Oven, , Preheat oven to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C). Also, grease a baking/casserole dish with some oil or vegan butter., , Step 8: Add Filling To Tortilla, , Spread 2 heaped tablespoons (100-120 g) of enchilada filling over a tortilla., , , Step 9: Roll Up Tortilla, , Roll up the tortilla and place it into the prepared baking dish., , , Step 10: Repeat, , Repeat this step with the other tortillas., , , Step 11: Add Sauce, , Then pour the enchilada sauce over the tortillas. I made two layers of 4 tortillas each (7 x 11 in baking dish) but you can make just one layer with 8 tortillas. The filling is enough for 12 tortillas, so you could also make more than 8 (depending on the size of your baking dish)., , , Step 12: Bake, , Bake the veggie enchiladas uncovered for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven, pour my easy, Vegan Cheese Sauce, on top (or use your favorite vegan cheese to taste), and put the enchilada casserole back into the oven for 10-15 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro or herbs of choice (optional). You can also add a little, Vegan Sour Cream, on top if desired., , , Helpful Tips and Variations, , , Sunflower seeds, \u2013 If you don\u2019t like sunflower seeds you can, of course, also use any other seeds or nuts instead. Walnuts are a great substitute, for example., , Other flour options, \u2013 Instead of ground oats, you can use any other flour of choice. For example, a gluten-free flour mix or chickpea flour. Just make sure you use the amount mentioned in the recipe in grams., , Tortillas, \u2013 I used, Homemade Gluten-Free Tortillas, . Sometimes I also use these gluten-free, Spinach Tortillas, . However, you can use regular wheat tortillas or wraps of choice if you aren\u2019t gluten-free., , You can use, , cooked beans, to make bean enchiladas or chickpeas instead of lentils. Textured protein (e.g. vegan beef) would be also an option., , Top with vegan cheese, \u2013 I topped these delicious gluten-free enchiladas with homemade vegan cheese sauce. That made them even more delicious, plus the sauce is ready in 3 minutes. However, you can certainly use store-bought vegan cheese instead!, , , , How To Store, , You can store the baked enchiladas covered in the fridge for, up to 3-4 days, . If you have sauce or filling leftovers, then store them separately in an airtight container in the fridge. This vegan enchilada recipe is also freezer friendly. Freeze in freezer bags for, up to 3 months, . Reheat covered in the oven until warmed through., , You can also, prepare the sauce and the filling ahead, and store it in the fridge, then assemble the enchiladas the next day., , Should you give these vegan enchiladas a try, please leave a comment and rating below, and don\u2019t forget to tag me in your Instagram or Facebook post with, @elavegan, and, #elavegan, , because I love to see your remakes., , , Other vegan Mexican inspired recipes you might like to try:, , , Mexican Pinto Bean Soup, , Vegan Tortilla Soup, , Breakfast Burritos, , Taco Cups, , Vegan Black Bean Quesadillas, , Loaded Nacho Fries, , Oven Roasted Vegetable Fajitas, , Mexican Pizza, with, Refried Beans, , Chili Sin Carne, , , , , , Vegan Enchiladas, , , Author:, Michaela Vais, , , plant-based, nut-free, perfect for lunch or dinner, and very tasty., , , 4.93, from, 77, votes, , , Servings, 12, , enchiladas, , , Prep, 40, minutes, , mins, Cook, 30, minutes, , mins, Total, 1, hour, , hr, , 10, minutes, , mins, , , , Rate recipe, , Print recipe, , Pin recipe, , , , , , , , , , Video, , , , , , , , , , , 1x, 2x, 3x, \u25a2, 12, , , , tortillas, , (22 cm in diameter), \u25a2, 7, , oz, , , (, 200, , g, ), , vegan cheese, , or to taste, Enchilada filling:, \u25a2, 1, , cup, , , (, 192, , g, ), , dry lentils, , (*see recipe notes), \u25a2, 2 \u00bd, , cups, , , (, 600, , g, ), , vegetable broth, \u25a2, \u00bd, , cup, , , (, 70, , g, ), , sunflower seeds, , (*see recipe notes), \u25a2, 1 \u2153, , cup, , , (, 120, , g, ), , rolled oats, , gluten-free if needed (*see recipe notes), \u25a2, 3, , heaped tbsp, , , (, 120, , g, ), , tomato paste, \u25a2, 2, , small, , , , bell peppers, \u25a2, 1, , medium-sized, , , , carrot, , grated, \u25a2, 1, , medium-sized, , , , tomato, , chopped, \u25a2, 2, , cloves, , , , garlic, , minced, \u25a2, 1, , large, , , , onion, , chopped, \u25a2, 2, , tbsp, , , , chia seeds, , (ground) or flax seeds, \u25a2, , , spice mix:, , 1/2 tbsp onion powder, 1/2 tbsp garlic powder, 2 tsp dried oregano, 1-2 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp smoked paprika, \u25a2, 1-2, , , , hot chili peppers, , chopped (or less if you don't like it too spicy), \u25a2, , , sea salt and pepper, , to taste, \u25a2, 1, , tbsp, , , , oil, , to fry the veggies, Enchilada sauce:, \u25a2, 1, , tbsp, , , , olive oil, \u25a2, 1, , tbsp, , , , gluten-free flour, , (or all-purpose flour if not GF), \u25a2, 2 \u00bd, , cups, , , (, 600, , g, ), , tomato sauce, \u25a2, , , spice mix:, , 1/2 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, \u25a2, , , sea salt and pepper, , to taste, , salt + pepper, the oats, the sunflower seeds, and the ground chia seeds) into a food processor and blend for about 20-30 seconds., , Add the cooked veggies and the tomato paste, and blend again., , Finally, add the cooked lentils and blend until everything is combined.

Couldn\u2019t tell I used half and half sunflower seeds and walnuts, carrots, onion and red bell pepper but they were all pur\u00e9ed beyond recognition.

Yes a little work but you\u2019re right, some recipes are more time consuming than others and you never claimed that these would be the fastest dinner ever so I knew to set aside lots of time!

We haven\u2019t tried this recipe without cashews so we cannot guarantee results, but you could possibly omit the cashews and increase the pumpkin, and the sauce just won\u2019t be as creamy. It\u2019s also possible coconut cream would work (if you can have coconut) or possibly hemp seeds, silken tofu, or sour cream (vegan or dairy)., , , Reply, , , , , , , , , , Darcie Clark, , says, , , May 1, 2023 at 8:22 pm, , , , A most versatile, simple, and delicious recipe!, I swapped spinach for the kale and added one steamed diced sweet potato to the filling.

I included grated monterey jack cheese in one tray for the non-vegan\u2019s, and no cheese in the second tray.  The enchiladas were a huge hit!  Everyone loved them!  The sauce is delicious, and the filling really yummy.  It was surprisingly easy to make.  The sauce was too hot for me.

The final product was a hit at dinner with our friends. I also made the avocado crema but I should have used more water since it wasn\u2019t liquid enough.  Next time I will do better.

I was skeptical that enchiladas with a homemade sauce could be made this quickly. The flavors suggest something far more complicated than the effort needed here. I multiplied this by 1.5 to have 12 enchiladas, but ended up with 16 plus some filling left to spare (which was great in a quesadilla as well as a dip with corn chips!) I left the amount of chipotle peppers the same however and that was the perfect amount of heat for us. Subbed Swiss chard for the kale which tastes great with the pumpkin. A keeper for sure.

I did end up finding them \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it would make a huge difference. I think a coconut lime crema would be lovely on top of this and would not require any nuts at all., , , , , , Reply, , , , , , , , Support @ Minimalist Baker, , says, , , October 19, 2022 at 9:49 am, , , , Lovely!

It\u2019s also possible that coconut cream would work (if you can have coconut) or possibly hemp seeds, silken tofu, or sour cream (vegan or dairy)., , , Reply, , , , , , Primary Sidebar, , , , Search for, , , , , , , Recipe Key, GF, , Gluten-Free, VG, , Vegan, V, , Vegetarian, DF, , Dairy-Free, NS, , Naturally Sweetened, , Want More Deliciousness?, Get our copy of, FAN FAVORITES, featuring 20 of our most loved, highly-rated recipes!, Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form., Email, *, Phone, Submit, , , Find Us, , Facebook, , Instagram, , Pinterest, , Twitter, , YouTube, , Minimalist Baker Brandmark, Simple Recipes That, , Make You Feel Good, Recipes, , Cookbook, , Shop, , About, , \u00a9MinimalistBaker.com, , Privacy Policy, , Terms, , , , , Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form., Email, *, Message, Submit, , , , X, , , , , , , , , , Want More Deliciousness?, , Our FREE 49-Page Fan Favorites e-Book has 20 recipes we think you\u2019ll LOVE!, , Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form., Email, *, Phone, Submit, , , , , , X, , , , , , , , , , Want More Deliciousness?, , Our FREE 49-Page Fan Favorites e-Book has 20 recipes we think you\u2019ll LOVE!, , Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form., Email, *, Comment, Submit, , , , , , X, , , , , , , Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form., Email, *, Message, Submit, , , , X, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C)., SAUCE: Prepare the sauce following, this recipe, . You\u2019ll need ~1 batch or 4 \u00bd cups (1070 ml) sauce total for the enchiladas., FILLING: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften. Add the bell pepper, kale, and salt and cook, stirring frequently, until the kale is wilted and no longer bright green \u2014 about 4-5 minutes., Add the drained and rinsed black beans, 3 cups (710 ml) enchilada sauce, and 1/4 cup (60 ml) water (adjust amounts if altering default number of servings). Stir and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat slightly, cover, and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the black beans to soak up the flavors of the sauce., ENCHILADAS: To make your tortillas more pliable and less prone to cracking (skip this step if using flour tortillas), place them in a single layer directly on the oven rack for about 30-60 seconds to heat through, then wrap in a clean dish towel to keep them warm. Alternatively, you can wrap them in a damp towel and microwave for 30 seconds., Pour ~1/2 cup (120 ml) of enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9\u00d713-inch (or similar size) baking dish. Spread to coat the bottom of the dish., Take one tortilla and lay it down in the dish. Place a generous amount of filling (~1/2 cup) on one end, then roll it up and tuck the enchilada against the side of the baking dish, seam side down. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. If there\u2019s any leftover filling, you can either add it to the casserole dish or serve it in, quesadillas, or, bowls, ., Pour the remaining sauce (~1 cup or 240 ml) over the top of the enchiladas and use a spoon to distribute the sauce into the cracks. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until warmed through and a little crackly on top., Served topped with sliced avocado and chopped cilantro (optional)., Leftover enchiladas will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for 3-4 days or in the freezer for 1 month. Reheat in the microwave or in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 15-20 minutes or until warmed through., For freezing, we like to prepare the enchiladas up to the point of baking, then freeze unbaked (preferably in single-serving portions). When ready to cook, let thaw at room temperature for 20-30 minutes, then reheat as instructed above., , Video, , Notes, *Prep time includes preparing the enchilada sauce., *Inspired by Ambitious Kitchen\u2019s, Spicy Black Bean Chicken Enchiladas with Pumpkin Sour Cream Sauce, .",

And there is a You Tube video of them being made by a vegan vlogger who also loved them. But, having said that, we all have different tastes.

I used a different mac sauce as cashews aren\u2019t something we can just buy here without going in the red but I made sure to find one super close to it. The taquitos themselves are PHENOMENAL. If you\u2019re like me and accidentally blended the chickpeas a little too far (hummus anyone?), I would recommend adding a tad bit more artichoke. Also, nutmeg surprisingly brings out the flavour of paprika if you love the smokiness like I do., , One question I do have is what to do with the extras? I made so much because I was so excited and have about 1.5 cups left of the mix with no idea how to use it besides blend it again and make a dip. Any suggestions?, , , Reply, , , , , , , , Jenn S., , , February 25, 2019 at 8:07 pm, , , , Oh yay, so glad you loved them! I\u2019ve had several readers make the sauce using white beans with success\u2026fyi\u2026but glad you found one that worked for you. As for leftovers, I might spread it on toast for breakfast or sandwich it between two slices of bread for lunch. Maybe make a buddha bowl\u2026add some rice and greens and mix it all together.

The ranch puts it over the top for sure. I added 1/2 of a jalape\u00f1o to my ranch and it\u2019s amazing I love it!

My husband and I are slowly adding more plant based meals into our diet and these were amazing!

So happy to hear you love them. I would suggest placing them on a parchment lined cookie sheet or large plate and freezing them. Once frozen, you could transfer them to a plastic freezer bag.
